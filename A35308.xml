         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>VVE are doubtleſs brought forth in a Day to which many Glorious Prophecies contained in the Holy Scriptures have a ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; amongſt others, that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 4. <hi>Many ſhall run to and fro, and Knowledg ſhall be increaſed.</hi> Antichriſtian Darkneſs hath ſo covered the <hi>European Nations</hi> for many Hundreds of Years, that the Truths and Ordinances of Chriſt were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Corrupted and Obſcured; till our Bleſſed Reformers, <hi>Luther, Calvin, &amp;c.</hi> were raiſed up in ſome good meaſure, to detect the corruptions of Antichriſt, and to bring to Light that bleſſed Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, in the Blood of Chriſt, with ſeveral other Truths of great Importance.</p>
            <p>And ſince that, God has been pleaſed to raiſe up many Learned Men, namely Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> with others, who have Learnedly, and with much clearneſs and ſtrength of Argument made it appear, that a true Goſpel viſible Church, is to conſiſt only of ſuch as are Saints by Profeſſion, and who give up themſelves to the Lord, and one to onother by Solemn Agreement, to practiſe the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now of latter Years the Lord hath been pleaſed to raiſe up ſome worthy and learned Men to detect the vanity of Infant <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> who by ſolid Arguments have made the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs thereof appear.</p>
            <p>The main Arguments that are made uſe of by <hi>Paedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> for the ſupport of their Practice herein, are taken from the <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some of themſelves confeſſing, That Arguments taken from the <hi>Baptizing</hi> of whole Families, from <hi>Chriſt's</hi> bleſſing lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb facs="tcp:50207:3"/> Children, and from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7, 14. have no weight in them. And as for thoſe Arguments which are taken from the <hi>Covenant</hi> made with <hi>Abraham</hi> above-mentioned, ſeveral of our Learned Authors have thorowly examined, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently anſwered. Notwithſtanding we cannot without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to Truth omit to reccommend the Labours of this our worthy Brother, who having had the advantage of other Men's Writings, that have gone before him, and ſo ſtanding on their Shoulders, may ſee further than they did. Yet he hath ſome Nations of ſo rare a Nature, that he is not behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any other for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only to his own ſtudiouſneſs and dexterity, and the Bleſſing of God upon his Labours.</p>
            <p>We freely acknowledge, that many Learned and Holy Men, whom we much Honour, do differ from us in the point of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> yet we muſt not let go any Truth of God for their ſakes: And we doubt not, but the time is drawing nigh, when God will cauſe the Light of His Holy Word ſo to ſhine forth, that all remaining Darkneſs on the Minds of the Lord's People ſhall vaniſh away; and then <hi>Sion's Builders</hi> ſhall no more take a Stone for a Corner, nor a Stone for a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Babylons Rubbiſh.</hi>

            <p>HAving had a ſight of this Piece (without the Privity of the Author) before it went to the <hi>Preſs,</hi> I Read it with much Delight (though in great haſte) and thought good without his Knowledge, or being Deſired, to give thee (if thou beeſt a Stranger to him) this aſſurance by the way, that thou wilt find his Lines altogether free from Lightneſs, as alſo from Reflections or Reproaches towards thoſe of the Perſwaſion he contends with; which is a thing ſo rare, that it deſerves a Remark, and ſavours much of a right ſerious Chriſtian Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. I have had Knowledge of him many Years, but never knew (or heard) him otherwiſe repreſented, then of a very ſober Character, ſuitable to his Writings; a Man every way free from any of thoſe Temptations that might incline him to eſpouſe any Intereſt, or fall in with any Perſwaſion, otherwiſe than what he did freely out of pure Choice, and as ſatisfi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d with its Purity, upon a diligent and conſcionable Peruſal of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> in which he has been a very laborious Searcher theſe many Years, and in whom that Text is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16. <hi>That they make the Man of</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50207:4"/> 
               <hi>God wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. I am aſſured that his Papers were intended only for private Uſe, and for ſatisfaction of ſome that deſired to know what he had to ſay to the Arguments here reply'd to. He has all the appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a Man low in his own Eyes, yet willing in his capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to ſerve the Lord Jeſus freely, without ſeeking in the leaſt any advantage to himſelf in the ſervice of the Goſpel; boing much above thoſe low Ends that too too many are ſway'd by, of making a Gain by his Preaching; and though his Labours be conſtant, yet he ſeeks no other reward, then Chriſt's <hi>Well done, &amp;c.</hi> being very well contented with that Income for his Subſiſtence, which the Lord affords in the uſe of his honeſt and honourable Calling; in which alſo he has been beneficial to many, and a great Bleſſing to the Poor; ſo that by his Faithfulnoſs and Uſefulneſs in his Spirituals and Temporals he is well reported of amongſt all. It would be a great Happineſs both to the Church of Chriſt and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth, if the number of ſuch Worthys were every where increaſed: And yet I fear that this good Man in theſe his Faithful endeavours to reduce Chriſtian Practice to Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Inſtitution (though done with all Mildneſs and much Demonſtration) will meet with hard Uſage from that ſort of Men, which in every Age have chiefly ſought what would pleaſe Man, and have ſtill quarrelled at all endeavours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Reformation: Witneſs thoſe hardſhips which the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful met with from the <hi>Papiſts</hi> for many Generations, for their <hi>Nonconformity</hi> to their <hi>Inventions,</hi> and thoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that obſtructed the Reception of the great Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith alone in the Mediator. How dear did it coſt many of the Ancients before it could be obtained that the People ſhould receive the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> in both Kinds, which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſtill deny to them? How long was it before the Diſciples of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Innocent</hi> the Firſt, would give over that Practice of giving the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> in a Spoon
<pb facs="tcp:50207:4"/> to Children aſſoon as they were <hi>Baptized;</hi> which held (as <hi>Maldonate</hi> affirms) about 600 Years? And to this Day, How many are contending for the <hi>Croſs</hi> in Baptiſm? For which thing (though very Un-ſcriptural, yet) ſome of the deep Wits of that Way do form a Plea, but by miſtaken and very invalid Conſequences. And many of the Wiſe and Learned of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are of Opinion, That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be granted that the <hi>Church</hi> has a Liberty from Chriſt to alter or add Ceremonies at her diſcretion, they know no Authority for the Baptizing of Infants, or the Sprinkling of Water upon their Faces to be accounted Baptiſm; for few deny but that the ancient way was by going into the Water, and Plunging under Water. Nay, our Diſciplinarians that have made ſtrong Pleas for Reformation in many things, muſt, and do confeſs, that their ſtrongeſt Plea for Infant Baptiſm is drawn from a very remote Conſequence, even as far off from the Command of Chriſt, or the Practice of the Apoſtles; as that they ground it on the Firſt <hi>Jewiſh Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> Commanded unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſterity, <hi>viz. Circumciſion,</hi> which was never intended to be of any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue after the time of <hi>Chriſt's Reformation. Heb.</hi> 9. 10. And is it not to be lamented that after ſo many Years ſearch, no better Footing ſhould be found for the Practiſing a <hi>New Teſtament Sacrament,</hi> than an <hi>Old Teſtament Jewiſh Inſtitution?</hi> May not ſuch men as will infer, that Holy Orders ſhould be Hereditary, and that the Work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry ſhould be Intailed upon their Poſterity, becauſe it was anciently ſettled upon the Children of <hi>Levi,</hi> beſides whom none might Miniſter in the Sanctuary? And why may not Infants by a clearer Conſequence partake of the Table of the Lord, aſſoon as they are able to Eat and Drink it; it being taken for granted by <hi>Paedobaptiſts</hi> that the Supper comes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n the room of the Paſſover, and that all in the Family that were capable to Eat Fleſh might Eat it. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 4. Nay,
<pb facs="tcp:50207:5"/> any Strangers in their Families were not excluded that we Read of, that might be preſent at the Paſſover. And thus we might Inſtance in many things.</p>
            <p>It is not the buſineſs of this Author to <hi>prove</hi> the Baptiſm of Believers, for that is a thing that was never yet denied or oppos'd, by any that Plead for Infants right to it: For they confeſs, That to Baptize Believers is a clear and unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Truth, agreeing moſt plainly with the precept of the Lord Jeſus, and Practice of the Apoſtles. But the Controverſie is, whether Infants (of Believers, or others) have a Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral right to it, or not? And here thou ſhalt find every Point from whence any Plea is deduced, to prove the right of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to that Ordinance anſwered, with ſuch Evidence of Scripture Demonſtration, and with ſo much Faithfulneſs, that (unleſs thou haſt no Conſcience towards theſe things) it must beget in thee at leaſt ſome new Conſiderations about the Point, if not a better Opinion of that deſpiſed People, that make Conſcience not to admit any to Baptiſm, but Profeſſed Believers.</p>
            <p>The Circumciſion of Children was not left doubtful to the Jews, but they had full Direction in the Caſe, both for the Subject and the Part to be Circumciſed, the time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner alſo. Was there ſuch care in that time, and in ſuch a Point, about a thing that was to end with the Jewiſh Church, Law and Prieſt-hood; and yet no care taken by the Lord Jeſus to give future Ages Light in Infant Baptiſm, in caſe it were His Mind it ſhould be Practiſed? I could never yet meet with the Man that could pretend to know at what time Children ſhould or ought to be Baptized, ſuppoſing they had a right to it. In Ancient time it was Adminiſtred but twice in the Year; and ſince that appointed to be upon ſome Feſtival. But I find now, all do act at Pleaſure, none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us regarding the Day of Circumciſion, <hi>viz. the eighth Day;</hi> though ſome in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time would limit it to that
<pb facs="tcp:50207:5"/> Day, when the practice began firſt to be Introduced by ſome few Perſons, out of a conceit of its Abſolute Neceſſity to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, from a miſtake of <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. But ſome now haſten it ſooner; ſome defer it to a Fortnight, ſome three Weeks, a Month, and more. And ſeveral of the <hi>Eaſtern Churches</hi> to this very day, Baptize not, until the 40th. day after they are born; and then give them the <hi>Supper</hi> alſo, as ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Authors report. So that all, for the moſt part, order the time, as may beſt ſuit with their other Aim, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging it with State, Pomp and Honour, and the preſence of ſuch Friends as may be abſent, to make it the more gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſplendid. Now if no time can be ſet exactly, why ſhould they be cenſured, who out of Conſcience, defer to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate ſo Holy an Ordinance to their Children, till they are taught in the Faith of Chriſt, and profeſs to believe it with their Heart? Muſt it not ſeem ſtrange, I ſay, to any Man that reads, with what care the Lord gave charge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Circumciſing of Children as well as Men; giving them the very Circumſtance of time as aforeſaid, on which it ſhould be performed, and which <hi>Moſes</hi> injoyned to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was part of his Faithfulneſs in his Houſe, that yet we ſhould think it is the Mind of the Lord Jeſus, (who was moſt faithful in his own Houſe) that little Children ſhould be Baptized, and not ſo much as once expreſs it by Himſelf, or Apoſtles? We find <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly mentioned by the Apoſtle, upon very ſmall Occaſions, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 5. where the taking notice of Children is of very little moment; and yet, where we have an Account who ſhould be Baptized, (as in Chriſt's Commiſſion) and of thoſe Multitudes, that in many places were Baptized; Is it not ſtrange that no Child ſhould be mentioned, if ſuch had been, or were to have been Baptized? The Apoſtle took care in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 12. to Record, that the Multitude then Baptized, were both <hi>[Men and Women.]</hi> If Cbildren had been
<pb facs="tcp:50207:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> then Baptized, ſurely the Holy Spirit, would not have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that one Word <hi>[Children.]</hi> And ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 14. We have mention of Multitudes added to the Church, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd particularly, <hi>[both Women <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>]</hi> Now if their Children had been taken in with them, would not the Holy Spirit have mentioned it, whilſt he foreſaw of what need it would be in future Ages, to warrant his People to do the like? The Holy Scriptures therefore being wholly ſilent, in the point of little Childrens Admittance, and nothing found for it in either Precept or Preſident, what may more clearly be inferred. But to conclude, that the Baptiſm of little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is more of Man than of God, or wholly of Man, and not of God.</p>
            <p>I could never yet learn what material Benefit an Infant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Baptiſm. It cannot be a bringing them into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, becauſe it is upon Suppoſition, that they are in Covenant, by vertue of their believing Parents, one or both, that a Plea is made for their Baptiſm. The moſt that can be ſaid or pretended to, is, that it. brings them into Chriſt's viſible Flock. But alas, what Priviledge is this, whilſt the Child is there, but as one aſleep? Nay, when this Child comes to Underſtanding, it muſt not partake of any other Benefits in that Church, more than one Unbaptized may do, until it comes to Confeſſion of Faith and Repentance, and receive Confirmation; and this Child after Baptiſm, as it grows up, is Preach'd to (as much as any other) as in a ſtate of Nature, and conſequently the Child of Wrath, and never like to come into the preſence of God with comfort, without Regeneration, or actual Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; by all which it appears, That the Priviledges preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to, are but Nominal, and without any ſubſtance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allity. What then is this noiſe of Priviledges made with Rhetorical Flouriſhes, but a meer Shadow and Pretence, to keep up an Opinion, for an Unſcriptural Practice in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb facs="tcp:50207:6"/> of the People, who are ready to be led to any thing by their Guides? As for Infants being the Subjects of Chriſtian Baptiſm, it deſerves to be well conſidered, who gave command for it, either God or Man? And for the manner of Baptizing by ſprinkling Water on the Face only, by whoſe Direction was it? And where is the Scripture from whence any Probability may be found, that that part ſhould be ſprinkled more than any other? Why not the Breaſt, as a ſign of the Hearts being ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience? Or the Arms that ſhould manage the Shield? Or the Feet, in token of being ſhod with the Preparation of the Goſpel of Peace? Or rather that part, that of old was appointed to be circumciſed, in token of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation? I know 'tis frequently urged by the <hi>Poedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> to thoſe of the contrary Perſwaſion: Where do you find that <hi>Children</hi> are at any time, or in any place forbidden <hi>Chriſtian Baptiſm?</hi> Which is a strange kind of Plea. The very <hi>Jews</hi> were never in their greateſt Apoſtacy, ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in their reaſoning, that ever I heard of: It was enough that they practiced what they were commanded. Is the Text of no force, or quite forgotten, which tells us, <hi>That ſecret things belong to God, but revealed things to us?</hi> Would he have Infants Baptized before Faith, and not Reveal it?</p>
            <p>I could wiſh therefore, that all empty Pleas on either ſide, were put away, and careful Attendance given to things weighty and material. The changes that have been ſeen in the Opinions of men, as times have varied in theſe late years, may justly put every conſiderate man, upon the conſcionable ſearch, after what is the very <hi>Mind of Chriſt</hi> in the Holy Scriptures, and not to take any thing upon anothers credit, whilſt that Word is made intelligible, and unto which we may have all free Recourſe.</p>
            <p>I know there are ſome prophane ones, that will take a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to queſtion the Truth of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> but yet
<pb facs="tcp:50207:7"/> that ſhould not afright good men, from ſearching after the very mind of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in them; if our Fathers had not done ſo, we had abode in the depth of Antichriſtian Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I wonder that thoſe that plead for the Right of the <hi>Seed of Believers,</hi> to <hi>Chriſtian Baptiſm,</hi> from <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> do not as earneſtly plead for a right for the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Wife, from the right of the Husband, and for the Servants alſo, whatever they be, ſince ſuch were not only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but commanded to be <hi>Circumciſed?</hi> Why are not our <hi>American Planters,</hi> that buy multitudes of <hi>Negro's,</hi> required to baptize them as faſt as they buy them, and their <hi>Children</hi> born in their Plantations? Methinks it ſhould clearly follow, from the ſame way of arguing.</p>
            <p>But to conclude, What is <hi>Abraham</hi> to us? We muſt make our claim to Holy Things by a right to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by him, who is the great and only Head of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and prove Infants Right to him, or Deſcent from him, or elſe all will be found as Dung and Droſs. I ſhall not detain thee longer (being not to diſpute, but to glance at things) from beholding at large in this Treatiſe, this great Point par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly handled; and if thou art but as ſerious and Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, in reading it, as the Author, (whoſe Pardon I crave, for adding this without his Knowledge) I verily believe was in writing it, thou wilt not think thy money nor labour loſt. Now the God of Truth and Peace, that hath made his very mind communicable to us, through his dear Son, give us all Light therein, and willing minds to obey him. So Prays</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Do now Preſent Thee with a New Treatiſe of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> wherein that of Believers, is Aſſerted to be the only true Chriſtian Baptiſm, by way of Oppoſition to that of Infants: Which I hope thou wilt find in the Enſuing Diſcourſe to be Demonſtrated, and with Scripture Evidence to be cleared up, notwithſtanding the many plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Arguments or Objections which are uſually urged for the ſupport of the contrary Practice. In the Compiling of which, after having Humbly and Earneſtly Implored the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance. I do confeſs that I have been much beholding to the pious Induſtry, and laborious Travels of others that have trodden the ſame Path, and have gone before me treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſame Subject, from whom I have been ſupplied with many of the Materials in point of Argument, which this preſent Diſcourſe is furniſh'd with.</p>
            <p>I know it will be objected, that the preſent Work is needleſs, unleſs any thing further be produced than hath been by others
<pb facs="tcp:50207:8"/> already Urged, and argued in this preſent Controverſie. By way of Anſwer unto which, I have two things to offer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt;</hi> That though very much hath been already ſaid by others, that have Laboured in the ſame Province, and that with that clearneſs of Evidence, and Scripture Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by way of Oppoſition unto Infant Sprinkling, as cannot be refuted, unleſs another Canon or Scripture Oracle can be produced for the Justification thereof, than we have yet met with; yet thoſe ſeveral Works of their having their ſeveral Excellencies, and ſome of them being Voluminous, I judged it no needleſs or unprofitable Labour, to Collect the Sum or Subſtance of what hath been already ſaid in this Reſpect, and to preſent it to thy View in one Intire Piece; and that with as much Succinctneſs and Brevity as the Matter would well require.</p>
            <p>The Second is this; That peradventure thou may'ſt find, upon a due Peruſal of the enſuing Diſcourſe, an Improvement of ſeveral Conſiderable Scriptures and Arguments to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in the preſent Eſſay, that hath not yet been made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that I know of, by any other hand; and in particular, among diverſe others, as to what concerns the true Nature and Difference betwixt the two Covenants, that of Works, and that of Grace: Wherein I think I have plainly proved, that the Covenant which God made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> at <hi>Mount Sinai. Exod.</hi> 20. That made with the ſame People in the Land of <hi>Moab. Deut.</hi> 29. As alſo the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion made with <hi>Abraham. Gen.</hi> 17. 7. 8. 9. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo much ſtreſs is laid for the ſupport of Infants Baptiſm, were all of them no other than three ſeveral Repetitions of the Covenant of Works; and that as contra-diſtinct, or eſſentially different from the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and conſequently now Repealed. Which I have the rather taken the pains diſtinctly to prove, becauſe upon this Hypotheſis, or Suppoſition, that theſe were Goſpel <hi>Covenants,</hi> differing from the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb facs="tcp:50207:8"/> only in the manner of Adminiſtration, the greateſt part of the moſt plauſible Arguments for the ſupport of Infants Baptiſm, are founded. But if I have ſubſtantially proved that neither of theſe forementioned <hi>Covenants</hi> were Goſpel <hi>Covenants,</hi> reaching Gentile Believers and their Seed, but Eſſentially different therefrom, and conſequently now repealed; no wonder if I have made an anſwerable Improvement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by way of Oppoſition to the forementioned Practice.</p>
            <p>The Deſign therefore, and Scope of the following Treatiſe, (Beſide what concerns the Nature and Difference betwixt the two <hi>Covenants,</hi> the true Knowledge and Underſtanding whereof, is indeed of higheſt Importance to us) is, with all Humility, to endeavour the Rectification of that which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but apprehend to have been amiſs, and the promoting of that which I cannot but Judge to have been greatly defective among many that are right dear and precious in the ſight of GOD; And that is (among other things) in reſpect of the Purity of that Divine Worſhip, which as the Servants of <hi>Chriſt</hi> we are obliged to offer up to Him, in a due Suſception and Adminiſtration of that <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Solemn</hi> Ordinance of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> we are now contending about. My Reaſons why I ſo think, I have now given you in this preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. And certainly the Purity of Divine Appointments, is worthy pleading for; it hath been the ſubject matter of many Prayers, and ſhould be of our joynt Endeavours.</p>
            <p>We Read in the Prophecy of <hi>Zechary,</hi> of a <hi>Candleſtick</hi> all of Gold. Zec. 4. 2. 3. <hi>And he ſaid unto me, What ſeeſt thou? And I ſaid, I have looked, and behold a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick all of Gold, with a Bowl upon the top of it, and the Seven Lamps thereon, and Seven Pipes to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Lamps, which were upon the top thereof; and two Olive Trees by it, one upon the right ſide of the Bowl, and the other upon the left ſide thereof. And Verſe 12. I anſwered again and ſaid unto him; What</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50207:9"/> 
               <hi>be theſe two Olive Branches, which through the two Golden Pipes, empty the Golden Oyl out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</hi> By the concurring conſent of all Interpreters, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by this <hi>Candleſtick</hi> all of Godl here ſpoken of, we are to underſtand that pure <hi>Church State</hi> which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to erect unto Himſelf in Goſpel Times. And certainly that muſt be a bleſſed Day, and a glorious Priviledge, when we ſhall come to have a <hi>Candleſtick</hi> all of Gold. A <hi>Candleſtick</hi> that hath a Golden Bowl, Golden Lamps, and Golden Pipes, for the reception and conveyance of the Golden Oyl. Will it not be a ſingular Favour to be the <hi>Children</hi> of that <hi>Church:</hi> All whoſe Members are Golden Members; whoſe Miniſters and Ordinances alſo are All of Gold, for the conveyance of the Golden Oyl of the Heavenly Bleſſing to the Comfort, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning and Satisfastion of the whole? But alas! So it is, that for the moſt part of thoſe that call themſelves, or that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be the true <hi>Churches of Chriſt</hi> at this day in the World, they are far from being a <hi>Candleſtick all of Gold,</hi> whether in reſpect of their Conſtitution and Miniſtry, or in reſpect of that Purity of Ordinances which God requires. For whilſt men do content themſelves rather, as it were with Leaden Pipes, that is, with Ordinances of an Humane Invention, the <hi>Golden Pipes,</hi> or <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, are thereby neglected and made void. And then no wonder if ſuch a <hi>Church</hi> have alſo many Leaden Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or ſuch as are unſuitable unto the <hi>Goſpel Characters All of Gold,</hi> being rather ignorant, prophane and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; who coming in, or being admitted at the wrong Door, are there ſuffered alſo to continue, to the hardning, and Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ruine of themſelves: which is the caſe of Millions, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Appointment, having been <hi>Sprinkled,</hi> or as they call it, <hi>Chriſtned</hi> in their Infancy, as having by vertue of their Natural Birth, an Intereſt in the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> are Induced thereby to reckon themſelves good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50207:9"/> and in a State of Salvation, without looking after the New Birth, or being acquainted with the Myſtery of the Spirit of Regeneration.</p>
            <p>It is no way to be doubted, but that where there is a pure Church, there are pure Ordinances. The Pipes are all of Gold, as well as the Church or Candleſtick it ſelf; that is, it hath only ſuch Ordinances, as have the ſtamp of Heaven upon them; even the things which Chriſt hath commanded, and thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as he hath commanded, and not otherwiſe. And it is equally as clear, that where thoſe Golden Pipes are wanting, or where the purity of Goſpel Ordinances is neglected, and Pipes of a baſer Alloy, are ſubſtituted in the Room of thoſe of Chriſt's Appointment; and thoſe alſo miſ-applied about wrong Subjects, there can be no <hi>true</hi> Church; much leſs can it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to that <hi>Purity</hi> that Chriſt expects. There can be no true Church, but what hath a Golden Conſtitution, Golden Lamps, and Golden Pipes for the Conveyance of the Golden Oyl. And if you ſay that you have not been without ſufficient Experience of the Gracious Preſence and Bleſſing of Chriſt, with and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you in your preſent way; I will not deny, but take it for granted that ſo it is: Yet this I will ſay, that we are under no Promiſe of having thc Golden Oyl conveyed unto us, but through the Golden Pipes. <hi>Teach them</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the World.</hi> If therefore we ſtep out of Chriſt's way, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rationally ſuppoſe our ſelves, to be, at leaſt, ſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, under the Influence of Chriſt's Bleſſing. What Chriſt may graciouſly afford unto his People that ſincerely ſeek unto him, according to the beſt light they have, though the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary Preparation may in ſome Points be Defective, is one thing; and what we may juſtly expect by vertue of a ſtanding Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, is another. Certainly, the nearer we come to him, and the more Exact and Punctual we are in the Expreſſions of our
<pb facs="tcp:50207:10"/> Love and Friendſhip to him, the more groundedly may we Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Anſwerable Diſcoveries of his Loving Favour unto us; and we can no otherwiſe demonſtrate our Friendſhip, than by being obedient to him, in the Obſervation of all thoſe things which he hath commanded us; and that both whatſoever they are, and howſoever he hath injoyned the Performance of them. That the Baptiſm of Believers is appointed by Chriſt as a Golden Pipe, among the reſt of the Golden Pipes of the <hi>New Teſtament Church,</hi> for the Conveyance of the Golden Oyl, or the Heavenly Unction, from himſelf to his Members, is an undeniable Truth, and cannot with any Juſtneſs of Pretence be contradicted. That the Baptiſm of Infants deſerves that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, is more than what the Scriptures do declare unto us; and peradventure at long run, you alſo may ſee Cauſe to ſay the ſame.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if a thorow Reformation in this Point might once be obtained; that is, if Miniſters Teach Firſt, and then Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize ſuch only as Profeſs Faith in the Lord Jeſus, and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life, evidenced by a Holy Converſation (that being the only Practice warrantable by, and Exemplified in the Word of God.) We might then juſtly hope to ſee the Accompliſhment of the forementioned Divine Prediction: <hi>A Candleſtick all of Gold:</hi> A Candleſtick that hath a Golden Bowl, Golden Lamps, and Golden Pipes; that is, <hi>a Pure Church-State,</hi> wholly Conſtituted and Regulated according to the Divine Preſcription and Pattern. And then alſo it would inevitably follow, that the Papal Antichriſtian Church muſt of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity Vaniſh and Expire: Since the Matter of that Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, is the Collective Body of the Nations, who having been ſprinkled in their Infant State, are thence beguiled into a Blind and Soul-cheating Deluſion, that they are good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and true Members of the Catholick Church; whom yet, becauſe of their Unbelief and Prophaneneſs; the Word of God Excludes from the Goſpel Church, and conſequently
<pb facs="tcp:50207:10"/> from Baptiſm till Converted. And I make no queſtion but it will be at laſt found, that to uphold the preſent Practice of Infant Sprinkling, is no other than to uphold and ſupport the main Pillar of that Apoſtate and Adulterous Church; that is, by bringing the Church into the World, and the World into the Church. And when the World is once brought into the Church; let us ſhew any difference if we can, betwixt that and the World; which yet our Saviour tells us are diſtinct, having choſen his Church <hi>out of the World.</hi> John 15. 19. 'Tis true, the time will be when <hi>the Kingdoms of this World ſhall become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt:</hi> But that cannot be pretended unto, in the preſent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of things, in the Heavens, and Earth that now are; wherein, we cannot ſay that one of a Thouſand, much leſs, that the whole World, is ſubject unto Chriſt's Scepter; and conſequently, far from the true Characters of Church-Memberſhip, according to the Goſpel Rule, <hi>All of Gold.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed 'tis great pity, but that <hi>every Plant which our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father hath not planted ſhould be Rooted up,</hi> and the preſent Corrupt Practice of Infant ſprinkling among the reſt; ſince there is nothing that can be more evident than this, that were but this corner Stone, that ſupports the Antichriſtian Fabrick, quite removed, the whole Building muſt of neceſſity totter; and then we might juſtly hope for a <hi>pure Church-State:</hi> Till which, as we cannot groundedly expect true Peace or Settlement in the World; ſo neither can we juſtly expect that <hi>the Name of the City ſhould be called</hi> Jehovah Shammah, <hi>the Lord is there.</hi>

An Anſwer to which you will find in the Enſuing Sheets; together, with Anſwers to all other the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Arguments, which are urged by others alſo to the ſame purpoſe As for Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> he is a Perſon, altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me: But though his Apprehenſions and mine, are different in the preſent point: And though he hath endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to whet up his Arguments with utmoſt keeneſs, and lays them on with greateſt force; condemning us as guilty of the greateſt Schiſm, and of all thoſe Direful Evils that are the Natural Conſequents of a Schiſmatical Separation from a true Church; yet to give him his due, his Language is fair, and his Diſcourſe free from thoſe Fiery and Paſſionate Heats, that uſually attend Diſcourſes of this Nature from other Pens. I ſuppoſe he will have no Cauſe to complain of being otherwiſe dealt with in the preſent Anſwer. Sure it is, <hi>That the Wrath of Man worketh not the Righteouſneſs of God.</hi> I pray God that the preſent Reply may be made Inſtrumental to the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Eyes, that he may ſee from whence he is fallen, and Repent, and do his firſt Works. Since the Writing of this, I am informed of Mr. <hi>Allen</hi>'s Deceaſe. I make no queſtion but that he and others alſo, will ſooner or latter be convinc'd, that the horrible guilt of Schiſm, and the conſequent Evils at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant thereon, were ſo far from being juſtly Chargeable on us, becauſe of our preſent Practice; that theſe things do rather lie at the Doors of thoſe that thus condemn us. I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured indeed to ſpeak with as much Advantage as I could, to the Conviction of him, and others, that I cannot but appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, to walk in a corrupt Path in this Reſpect: And having ſo done, I know no Reaſon any have to be offended, if they be in Love exhorted alſo to their Duty. <hi>Exhort one another</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50207:11"/> 
               <hi>dayly</hi> (ſaith the Holy Spirit) <hi>leſt any of you be hardned through the Deceitfulneſs of Sin.</hi> And in like manner, we are bid to <hi>provoke one another to Love, and to good Works.</hi> Whereof, this is none of the leaſt, and Wherein, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, upon a due and further Conſideration, you may find your ſelves to have been as yet Deficient.</p>
            <p>I Would by no means be underſtood in all this Diſcourſe, as if I intended to lay more than the proper ſtreſs, upon the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance we are Contending about. For moſt true it is, that though the Golden Oyl of the Heavenly Bleſſing, according to the ſtanding Promiſes of the Goſpel, is only, or for the moſt part, to be Conveyed to us, through the Golden Pipes of Goſpel Ordinances, which ſhould Engage us to the faithful Owning and Practice of them, and not to Indulge our ſelves in any Negligence, Deviation, or Regardleſsneſs about them; yet nevertheleſs, as great would the Errour be on the other hand, and it may be greater, to take up our Reſt here: For let the Pipes be never ſo pure and clean; Or let the Ordinances we plead for, be never ſo punctually Obſerved, according to the Divine Inſtitution, and the Pattern received in the Holy Mount; yet 'tis the Fountain muſt ſupply the Pipe, elſe it will yield nothing. The beſt Ordinances are dry and barren things in themſelves, unleſs by them, the Golden Oyl from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <item> As for the Arguments drawn from <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16, 17. From thence it is urged;
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Gentiles have the ſame Graffing into the true Olive which the Jews formerly had; Our Graffing in being Anſwerable to their preſent Caſting out: Now when they were taken in, they and their Children were taken in; when they were broken off, they and their Children were broken off: And therefore if our Graffing in be anſwerable to theirs, we and our Children are Graffed in together. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. p.</hi> 23 24</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly;</hi> Since our Graffing into the Olive Tree, the Church, is anſwerable to that of the Jews; Their Infants being Graffed in by Circumciſion, ſo muſt ours by Baptiſm. <hi>Anſwered. p.</hi> 24 25</item>
                     <item>Thirdly; <hi>If the Fruit be Holy, the Lump is alſo Holy. And if the Root be Holy, ſo are the Branches. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. p.</hi> 26</item>
                     <item>Fourthly. The Church of the Jews, and that of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles is ſtill the ſame; that is, it is ſtill the ſame Viſible Church now that it was then. And ſo much the Apoſtles Simile or Metaphor of Ingraffing will bear, or it ſignifies nothing: And if the viſible Church be the ſame, why ſhould not the Subjects be the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> Children; and the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> an External Badge given to the Children of the Church now, as well as under the Law? <hi>Anſwered. p.</hi> 27</item>
                     <item>Fifthly. As the ſame Church continued under the Goſpel which did exiſt, or was in being before: So the very ſame Church Members kept their places and ſtanding in it, which were of it before, except ſuch as were broken off by Unbelief, which must not be underſtood in reference to the little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Believing Jews; unleſs it can be made out that their little Children were guilty alſo of the ſame Sin of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, upon the Account of which others were thus broken off. <hi>Anſwered. p.</hi> 32</item>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50207:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <item> Sixthly. Since the Jewiſh Infants were under the former Adminiſtrataion; at the Call, Election, and Appointment of God, admitted with their Parents, as viſible Members of the Jewiſh Church; And ſince <hi>the Gifts and Callings of God are without Repentance.</hi> Rom. 11. 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We have Reaſon therefore to Conclude, that the Infants of Chriſtian Parents have the ſame right to a viſible Church Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip now, as theirs had then. <hi>Anſwered. p.</hi> 23.</item>
                     <item>Seventhly. If ſuch Infants are as much of the Church, and as much Abrahams ſpirituall ſeed, as ever Infants in the Old Teſtament Church were; then they can be no more uncapable than they were, of a Sollemn Admiſſion into the Church by the Ordinance of Initiation for the time being, as Baptiſm is now, as Circumciſion was then. <hi>Anſwered. p.</hi> 34.</item>
                     <item>Eightly. The Believing Gentiles are now graffed in not upon the Legall Branch, but upon the Root Olive, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffordeth all the Nouriſhment that either the Jews had, or the Gentiles have; which Root Olive is the Covenant of Promiſe, that was 430. yeares before the Law.

                        <hi>Obj</hi> 2. If Infants are now Excluded, there would be a very great change in the Extent of the Covenant; Narrower un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, than it was under the Law; And yet no notice in all the Book of God given of ſuch a change. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered</hi>

                     <item>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. What hope can we have of our Infants, if they muſt not be admitted to Chriſtian Baptiſm, nor reputed as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the common Body, and Church of the faithful. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. p.</hi> 38.</item>

                        <hi>Obj.</hi> 5. If Children may not now be Baptized, this makes the Priviledge of Believers under the Goſpel to be leſs than was theirs under the Law: for their Children were all admitted as Members of the Viſible Church, by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Circumciſion, and we cannot but Conclude that Priviledges for our ſelves and for our Children, are at leaſt, as Honourable, Large, and Comfortable as theirs. <hi>Anſwered. p.</hi> 38, 39.</item>

Circumciſion was a Seal of the New Covenant to Believers and their Seed under the Law; and therefore ſo is Baptiſm to the Seed of Chriſtian Parents under the Goſpel: The denial therefore of Baptiſm to Infants, in the denial of a great Priviledge which of Right belongs unto them. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. p.</hi> 39, 40.</item>

For the Childrens right to the Promiſe, is part of the Fathers Inheritance: For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe unto <hi>Abraham</hi> was; <hi>I will be a God to thee and to thy Seed after thee.

By way of conſequence therefore it naturally follows, that if Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, the Seal of the Goſpel Covenant, belonged to the Seed of Believers under the Law, then doth the Goſpel Seal Baptiſm, much more appertain to the Seed of Believers now, <hi>Anſwered</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 45. to 61.</item>

            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>Containing ſome Animadverſions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon a Late Dicourſe of Mr.</hi> William Allen; <hi>Entituled,</hi> A Perſwaſive to Unity: or, A Serious and Friendly Addreſs to the Nonconformiſts. <hi>And firſt in reference to his Arguments againſt the</hi> Antipaedobaptiſts.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>MR. <hi>Allen</hi>'s firſt Argument is; That a known Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtical Principle Condemns the Practice of Anabaptiſts themſelves. The Principle is; That Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is to be Interpreted as to the Extent of it, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Scripture Examples. And it Condemns the Practice of Anabaptiſts; becauſe there is no Scripture Example for the Baptizing ſuch Perſons as they Baptize, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of grown Age whoſe Parents were Chriſtians, and who have been Educated from their Child-hood in the Chriſtian Religion; but only ſuch as were newly Converted from Paganiſm or Judaiſm, to Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>To this we Reply. Firſt, That though it ſhould be granted, that there is no expreſs Example in the Scripture, concerning the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing Perſons at Age, whoſe Parents were Chriſtians; yet it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient unto us, that there are Examples enough in the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Baptiſm of <hi>Believers:</hi> So that let a Perſon be but a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,</hi> and we have no reaſon to enquire into his <hi>Pedigree;</hi> nor have we any Rule that ſo directs us, in Order to his Admiſſion to Baptiſm.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50207:17"/> And as we have no Rule nor Reaſon to accept of a Perſon that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, the rather becauſe he had Chriſtian Parents; ſo neither to Reject him on that Ground. Could the like Command or Examples be produced from the Scripture concerning the <hi>Baptiſm of Infants,</hi> as can eaſily be produced concerning the <hi>Baptiſm of Believers,</hi> (for under that Notion only are we bound to take Cognizance of thoſe Baptized by us;) the preſent Controverſie would ſoon be concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Argument will eaſily fall to the Ground, if we duly conſider the Scope of the forementioned Commiſſion concerning Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as it is Recorded. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>Go ye therefore and Teach,</hi> or Diſciple <hi>all Nations, Baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein, as the Order to be obſerved, is plainly Excluſive of Infants, who are uncapable of Teaching, or Diſcipleſhip by Inſtruction, as the Rule here directs: So it is as evident, that it Includes all other ſorts of Perſons that are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Actual Teaching, whether they be <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or whether they be the Off-ſpring of Pagans or Believers; there being therein no Exception of any, it extending to all ſorts of People in all Nations that are capable of being effectually taught or inſtructed in the Rudiments of the Chriſtian Doctrine, ſo as to make an Anſwerable Profeſſion of the ſame; which we hope it will not be denied, but that the Off-ſpring of Chriſtian Parents are as capable of, as others, if not more, by the Advantage of their Education, when coming to years of Underſtanding, and therefore are plainly included in the Commiſſion concerning Baptiſm, as well as others; which Infants are not, becauſe uncapable of being taught, as the Commiſſion directs.</p>
            <p>But againſt this it is objected, That if the Commiſſion. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Excludes none from Baptiſm but ſuch as are to be excluded by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therein to be obſerved: And if Baptizing and Teaching are to precede or follow one the other as there named by Chriſt: Then theſe two Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will follow.</hi> Firſt, <hi>That Infants are not there Excluded from Baptiſm.</hi> Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That a Perſon may be Baptized before he is Taught. And that theſe Propoſitions do follow from thoſe before mentioned, will appear from that Text in the Original, where, on a little Conſideration it may be obſerved, that the Order ſo much talk'd of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which ſo much ſtreſs is laid upon by the</hi> Anabaptiſts, <hi>is clearly for the</hi> Paedobaptiſts, <hi>and not for them.

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50207:17"/> 
               <hi>if the Mode of executing that general Commiſſion be expreſs'd in theſe where Baptizing is firſt, and Teaching comes after: What is become of the Order the</hi> Antipaedobaptiſts <hi>have ſo long talked of? Certainly, the inſiſting on the Order in that place, proves to them an unhappy Weapon to ſtab that Cauſe, for the defence of which it hath been brought into the Field.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Anſwer hereunto, we ſay; That how fatal ſoever you ſuppoſe it may prove to us, or the Cauſe we plead for, to inſiſt on the Order there mentioned: Of this we are ſure, that if we neglect the Order Chriſt himſelf hath appointed, we ſhall come ſhort of pleaſing him; and conſequently ſo to Teach, muſt needs prove an unhappy Weapon to ſtab that Cauſe, in the defence of which it is engaged.</p>
            <p>In the Scripture before us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. there are plainly 3 di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Acts required by Chriſt, in the Commiſſion he there gave his Apoſtles. Firſt, <hi>Go Teach,</hi> or Diſciple <hi>all Nations;</hi> that is, not by Baptizing them, as the Objection ſuppoſeth, and afterward to teach them,; but ſingly by the Preaching of the Goſpel unto them: For ſo it muſt of Neceſſity be underſtood, as appears by the Parallel Account that is given us of the ſame Commiſſion. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Go Preach the Goſpel to every Creature.</hi> Secondly, to Baptize them. So it follows in <hi>Mathew,</hi> that is; ſuch as ſhall give a believing Entertainment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: For ſo it follows in <hi>Mark. He that Believeth and is Baptized ſhall be ſaved:</hi> And accordingly, this was the conſequent Practice of the Apoſtles. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 37. <hi>If thou believeſt with all thine Heart thou mayſt.</hi> Thirdly, To teach them their following Duty; <hi>Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You tell us indeed <q>That a Perſon may be Baptized before he is Taught, and that if the Mode of executing the general Commiſſion be expreſs'd in theſe, where Baptizing is firſt, and Teaching comes after; What is become (ſay you) of the Order the <hi>Antipaedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> have ſo long talk'd of?</q> But it may rather be demanded; What then is become of the Order the <hi>Scriptures</hi> have ſo long ſpoken of? For if Baptizing is firſt, as you ſay, and Teaching comes after, then it will follow that the Apoſtles underſtood not their Commiſſion aright; for they always firſt endeavoured to make Diſciples by the Preaching of the Goſpel, and then Baptized thoſe that gave a Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Entertainment thereunto. So did <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch, he firſt Preached the Goſpel to him, and then Baptiz'd him. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. So did <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and the reſt with him. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. And ſo did the ſame <hi>Peter</hi> to the 3000. <hi>Jews</hi> that were converted by that Goſpel Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Recorded <hi>Act.</hi> 2. And accordingly, upon the Profeſſion of their Faith and Repentance, we are told <hi>Verſ.</hi> 41. <hi>Then they that gladly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Word were Baptized:</hi> And thus runs the whole Current of the Scripture, and no Example to the contrary. But according to your Doctrine, neither <hi>Philip</hi> nor <hi>Peter</hi> did well in Preaching to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50207:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> them firſt, and Baptizing them afterward: for (ſay you) Baptizing is firſt and Teaching comes after. 'Tis true, there is a ſort of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that comes after, as hath been before expreſs'd: But to ſay that a Perſon may be Baptized before he is Taught, is certainly Repugnant to the whole Doctrine and Practice of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And indeed, according to this Reckoning; If a Miniſter were to be ſent into a Foreign Land, among a Company of Ignorant Heathens, to Diſciple them to the Practice and Profeſſion of Chriſtianity: His firſt work muſt be to take them by the Shoulder, and to lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Water; or at leaſt by Surprize, to ſprinkle a little Water upon their Faces: For it may juſtly be doubted, few would readily ſubmit thereunto; unleſs they were firſt Taught, and Inſtructed in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of that ſacred Inſtitution. And if any ſhould be induced to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thereunto, without the Precedency of Preparatory Inſtructions: This Practice you ſee would be Foreign to the Doctrine and Practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. And therefore, certainly to inſiſt on ſuch an Order muſt needs prove an unhappy Weapon, to ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> that Cauſe, in the defence whereof 'tis thus engaged.</p>
            <p>The Scripture is indeed full in the Juſtification of the Order we now plead for, and to affirm the contrary, carries with it no ſmall Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, <hi>Go Teach,</hi> or Diſciple <hi>all Nations</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles) that is, according to the ſcope of the fore-mentioned Objection, Baptize them firſt, and Teach them afterward, this being the mode of executing that General Commiſſion: But is the <hi>Opus Operatum</hi> of Baptiſm, think you, a likely way or means to beget or bring forth Diſciples unto Chriſt? If Men be Preach'd by the Goſpel into Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſhip, it is no wonder, <hi>For it is the Wiſdom of God, and the Power of God unto Salvation, unto every one that believeth.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. 24. And accordingly where the Spirits Energy doth accompany it, it Diſciples Men into the very Life and Spirit of Chriſtianity. But we never read that Baptiſm was ever appointed for that end, whether by it ſelf, or in Conjunction with Preaching. It follows after, 'tis true, but not to make us Diſciples, but to ſhew that we are ſuch, as a viſible Mark to this purpoſe to be taken on us. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 26, 27.</p>
            <p>If you ſay that Baptiſm is not ſufficient to make a Diſciple or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, without the after-Teaching; How comes it then to paſs that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are Baptized, who are uncapable of the after-Teaching you ſpeak of? Many of whom, alſo dye in their Infancy, and ſo are never Taught, whether before or after: Of whom nevertheleſs it is affirmed; that <hi>the Baptized Infant is Regenerate, received into the Number of the Children of God, and an Heir of Everlaſting Life.</hi> And hence it is that the Baptiſm of Infants is commonly called the <hi>Chriſtening</hi> of them; that is, they are thereby made Chriſtians. So that though you ſeem to allow the Neceſſity of joyning Inſtruction with Baptiſm to make a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50207:18"/> or Chriſtian; yet the common Practice ſhews that Baptiſm aloue is reckoned ſufficient for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But (ſay you) <q>Theſe two Concluſions do plainly flow from the Premiſes. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that Infants are not there excluded from Baptiſm. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That a Perſon may be Baptized before he is Taught.</q> For Anſwer, you ſee we have plainly proved to you, from the conſtant Doctrine and Practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, that none ought to be Baptized before they are Taught. And then it will equally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and that with the ſame Clearneſs, that Infants are there excluded from Baptiſm, becauſe uncapable after an ordinary rate of being taught as the Goſpel directs.</p>
            <p>So that you ſee, the whole of your Argument falls to the ground. You may Criticize therefore at Pleaſure, and talk what you will of <hi>Imparative Moods,</hi> and <hi>Participles:</hi> You ſee we have diligently conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the general Scope of the Commiſſion, by comparing <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> together, and the conſequent Practice of the Apoſtles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who were beſt able to underſtand the meaning of it; wherein we have plainly proved to you the Antecedency of Teaching or Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Baptiſm: And therefore, unleſs you can produce another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for the Baptiſm of Infants, who are uncapable of being thus Taught, all you can ſay beſides will avail you nothing.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Allen</hi>'s Second Argument is derived from thoſe Words of our Saviour. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 14. <hi>Suffer Little Children, and forbid them not to come unto me, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> From whence it is Inferred, that if little Children are capable of a Memberſhip in the Kingdom, from the gracious Reſpect Chriſt bears unto them, then they are equally capable of the Sign or Cognizance thereof, which is, Baptiſm:</p>
            <p>For Anſwer, <hi>Frſt,</hi> it muſt be conſidered, that it remains as yet unproved, that the little Children here ſpoken of were <hi>Infants;</hi> the Context both here and elſewhere giving ſhrewd ground of Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, that they were rather ſuch little Children as were capable of making an <hi>Actual Profeſſion of their Faith in Cbriſt;</hi> which ſeems to be intimated by our Saviour. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 2. When having called a little Child unto him, and ſet him in the midſt of them, he ſaith, <hi>Ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little Ones that believe in me,</hi> &amp;c. Which after an ordinary rate cannot with any ſhadow of pretence, be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of <hi>Young Sucking Infants:</hi> For <hi>Faith cometh by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God;</hi> which ſuch little Children, according to an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Reckoning, are utterly uncapable of. Nor doth the Greek Word uſed <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 15. Which is tranſlated in Engliſh, <hi>Infants,</hi> prove it: For the Greek Word which is there tranſlated, <hi>Infants,</hi> as <hi>Piſcator</hi> himſelf tells us; ſignifies a <hi>Child capable of Teaching:</hi> As when it is ſaid, <hi>Timothy knew the ſacred Scriptures from a Child;</hi> that is, ever
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50207:19"/> ſince he was a <hi>Boy,</hi> not an <hi>Infant;</hi> it being the ſame Greek Word that is uſed in both places. It is an ungrounded Suppoſition therefore, that theſe were ſucking <hi>Infants</hi> of whom Chriſt here ſpeaketh; which till it can be proved, the Inference that is hence drawn, concerning the Baptizing of ſuch, muſt needs be acknowledged to have a very infirm and ſlender bottom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though it ſhould be granted that they were indeed <hi>Young Infants,</hi> that are here ſpoken of, as ſuch unto whom <hi>belongeth the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven:</hi> It may be (as <hi>Piſcator</hi> alſo obſerves) referred not to their preſent ſtate, as if for the preſent they were in the Kingdom of God, that is, Believers, and Juſtified; but that they were Elect Perſons, and ſo in time, of them ſhould be the Kingdom of God. Now that which gives right to Baptiſm, is the preſent ſtate of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It ought alſo to be duly conſidered; that the little Children here ſpoken of, whatever they were, are expreſly ordered to be brought unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who <hi>himſelf Baptized not,</hi> and not unto his <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi> whoſe proper Work that was: Nor is there any mention made at all of their <hi>Baptizing;</hi> but his <hi>laying his Hands upon them and bleſſing them.</hi> And from the Action of Chriſts bleſſing them, to infer that they are to be <hi>Baptized,</hi> proves nothing ſo much as that there is a want of better Arguments: For the Concluſion would with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability be derived thus. Chriſt bleſſed Children, and ſo diſmiſſed them, but Baptized them not; therefore Infants are not to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. But let this Argument be as weak as its Fellow; ſure we are that Chriſt hath other ways of bringing them to Heaven, than by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. And as we are ſure that God hath not commanded Infants to be Baptized; So we are ſure God will do them no Injuſtice, nor damn them for what they cannot help, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Parents Baptize them not. Many Thouſand ways there are by which God can bring any reaſonable Soul unto him; but nothing is more unreaſonable, than becauſe he hath tied all Men of Years and Diſcretion to this way, therefore we of our own Heads ſhall carry Infants to him that way, without his Direction. So to conceive is groundleſs, and the Action conſequent to it is too bold and venturous. Let him do what he pleaſes with our Infants, we muſt not.</p>
            <p>But it is Objected, That as it cannot be denied, but that it is our Duty to bring our Children unto Chriſt in the Arms of Faith and Prayer, (at leaſt,) in order to their receiving the Holy Spirit; ſo we are aſſured, that in all the things <hi>that we ask of him according to his Will he heareth us:</hi> And if ſo, <hi>who can forbid Water that theſe ſhould not be Baptized that have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?</hi> Act. 10. 47.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50207:19"/>
            <p> To this we Reply, That though it is indeed our Duty to be Wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with God for our ſelves, our Children, and others alſo, in Order to our obtaining the bleſſings of the Holy Spirit, for our ſelves and them; yet we have no ground certainly to conclude that God heareth our Prayers in this reſpect, for <hi>others than our ſelves.</hi> Of this we are aſſured, that if we ſincerely deſire it for <hi>our ſelves,</hi> God will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny us the ſame; having to this purpoſe given us his moſt faithful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>That he will give the Holy Spirit unto them that ask him.</hi> Luk. 11. 13. But we have not the ſame Aſſurance in reſpect of <hi>others;</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe being only to thoſe that ask it for <hi>themſelves:</hi> He ſaith not, that he will give the Holy Spirit to them that <hi>ask him not,</hi> or that <hi>deſire not the Knowledge of his Ways.</hi> True it is, that God is found ſometimes of them that do <hi>not ſeek him,</hi> and he may accordingly give the Holy Spirit to them that do <hi>not deſire him,</hi> when ſo it pleaſeth him: But he hath no where <hi>bound</hi> himſelf ſo to do. What he <hi>may do</hi> is <hi>one thing,</hi> and what he hath <hi>promiſed</hi> is <hi>another;</hi> and 'tis God's <hi>Promiſe</hi> only that we are to build upon in this reſpect. 'Tis true, we are to ask Gods Spirit, as for <hi>our ſelves,</hi> ſo for <hi>others</hi> alſo, that <hi>if peradventure</hi> they may receive the ſame benefit with <hi>our ſelves:</hi> And much more are we bound to become Petitioners to Heaven for our <hi>Children</hi> upon that Account: But till they are able to give ſome Convincing Evidence that our Prayers are <hi>heard,</hi> we have no juſt Reaſon to conclude that they are <hi>actually poſſeſt</hi> of ſo rich a Benefit, there being no Promiſe giving us Aſſurance to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>As for that Promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 21. which is mentioned by Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> upon this Account; It cannot without palpable ſtreining be applyed to the <hi>Natural Off-ſpring</hi> of Believers, now as he ſuppoſeth: It having a moſt plain and abſolute Reference to the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> ſpoken of in the foregoing <hi>Verſe,</hi> and can be applyed unto none other than unto <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>his Spiritual Seed;</hi> and that at the time of his ſecond Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 26. 27. Out of whoſe Mouth, God there Promiſeth, <hi>That his Spirit ſhould never depart, nor out of the Mouth of his Seed, nor out of the Mouth of his Seeds Seed for ever.</hi> Indeed, If God's Holy Spirit were abſolutely and everlaſtingly entailed upon all the <hi>Natural Off-ſpring of Believers;</hi> now, as our Opponents from this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture do affirm it is; this would be comfortable Tydings indeed, could it be ſubſtantially proved unto us: But alas! As the preſent Scripture proves it not, ſo neither doth any other that we know of; and were it ſo that God had any where promiſed, that at the Requeſt of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents he, would not fail to give his Holy Spirit unto all their <hi>Natural Seed:</hi> No doubt, <hi>Noah, Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choice Believers, recorded in the Scripture, were not defective in their Duty, to be wreſtling with God for their <hi>Off-ſpring</hi> in this Reſpect, that they <hi>all</hi> might be Partakers of his Holy Spirit, and conſequently
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50207:20"/> that they <hi>all</hi> might be made Inheritours of the Heavenly Kingdom, (For the Holy Spirit once given, as the Scripture before alledged, proves, was <hi>never more to depart from them.)</hi> But alas! Moſt evident it is, that notwithſtanding their moſt Zealous Prayers, and other Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous endeavours, for the Spiritual benefit of their <hi>Natural Off-ſpring;</hi> they had many of them ſuch <hi>Children,</hi> as were very Wicked, Flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Prophane, and ſuch as were <hi>rejected by God;</hi> which yet they had not been, had they been at all poſſeſſed of Gods <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> as the Fruit of their Parents Prayers and Supplications to God for them. And to this doth the dayly Experience that occurs to our own Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, very ſadly teſtify.</p>
            <p>The Sum then of our Anſwer to the forementioned Objection, is this; They that have <hi>Received the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or ſuch at leaſt, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whom there is any convincing Evidence thereof (as was the Caſe of them in the 10. <hi>Act.</hi> of whom this word was ſpoken) ſuch are the proper Subjects of <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> For <hi>who can forbid Water that ſuch ſhould not be Baptized?</hi> But till there can be convincing Evidence given concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Children, that either all or any of them are actually partakers thereof; according to this Rule, they are not the <hi>proper Subjects</hi> of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm:</hi> And therefore till then they are not to be <hi>Baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for Mr. <hi>Allen</hi>'s Third Argument, drawn from <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. We ſay that that Scripture is by him and others impertinently alledged to this purpoſe: It being to be underſtood not of ingrafting into the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church</hi> by an outward Ordinance, as Baptiſm; but into the <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> by Election, and giving of Faith, as the whole Chapter ſhews.</p>
            <p>His Fourth Argument is drawn from. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>For the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Husband is ſanctified by the Wife, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving Wife is ſanctified by the Husband, elſe were your Children unclean, but now are they holy;</hi> from whence he would infer, that the Children of Believers are Holy with a <hi>faederal</hi> or Covenant Holineſs, and therefore to be Baptized.</p>
            <p>To this we Reply; That the ſame ſort of <hi>Holineſs</hi> is aſcribed to the <hi>Children,</hi> as is to be underſtood in reference to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving Husband,</hi> or the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving Wife,</hi> who are both here ſaid to be <hi>Sanctified</hi> by their Reſpective Yoak-Fellows; which cannot be underſtood of a <hi>Faede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> or <hi>Covenant Holyneſs,</hi> but that which is <hi>Matrimonial:</hi> For if we muſt underſtand it of a <hi>Covenant Holyneſs,</hi> then it will follow that the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Wife,</hi> or the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving Husband,</hi> may upon the ſame ground lay claim to <hi>Baptiſm</hi> as well as their <hi>Children;</hi> which yet your ſelves will not grant. Beſides, it is evident from the Words themſelves, in which the term <hi>Believer</hi> is omitted, which would not be, if the <hi>Holineſs</hi> were derived from the <hi>Faith</hi> of the one Party, and ſo to be underſtood of a <hi>Covenant Holineſs.</hi> And the ſingle terms of <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife</hi> are twice uſed, which ſhews that the Holineſs is from the <hi>Conjugal Relation,</hi> and cannot b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> meant of any other than <hi>Legitimation.</hi> And the term <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:50207:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> is alſo twice uſed, and ſaid to be <hi>Sanctified;</hi> which can have no other ſence but this, That the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving</hi> Yoke-fellow is <hi>Sanctified</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Conjugal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> to his or her Yoke-fellow; and ſo though the one be an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever,</hi> they might comfortably enough live together in <hi>Lawful Wedlock.</hi> For elſe, ſaith he, your Children were to be accounted <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean,</hi> that is <hi>Illegitimate:</hi> But this being determined, that the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is thus <hi>Sanctified</hi> to the Wife, and the Wife to the Husband, though the one be an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever,</hi> hence it follows that your <hi>Children are Holy,</hi> that is, <hi>Lawfully begotten,</hi> which is the only ſence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ppoſite to the Determination. <hi>verſe</hi> 12. 13. And as for the uſe of the Word <hi>Holy</hi> for <hi>Legitimate,</hi> that it is in this Sence uſed elſewhere in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is evident from <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 15. Where a <hi>Seed of God</hi> can be underſtood in no other ſence than that of a <hi>Lawful Seed</hi> in Oppoſition to thoſe born by <hi>Polygamy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though it ſhould be allowed that the <hi>Holineſs</hi> in the Text is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be underſtood of a <hi>Faederal</hi> or <hi>Covenant Holineſs;</hi> yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore grant, That that is a ſufficient Reaſon for the Baptiſm of <hi>Infants:</hi> For let the <hi>Holineſs</hi> in the Text be what it will, whether <hi>Moral, Faederal,</hi> or <hi>Matrimonial,</hi> neither of theſe is either there, or elſewhere aſſigned to be a <hi>Ground</hi> of Baptizing Children upon; that which is laid down in the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> being that alone that can <hi>Warrant</hi> the ſame. It is <hi>God's Word</hi> only, not <hi>our Reaſon</hi> that can Juſtifie <hi>our Practice</hi> in <hi>God's Ordinances.</hi> That a <hi>Profeſſion of Faith and Reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> is a Subſtantial Warrant for <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is undeniable to be proved from the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> But that ſo is <hi>Faederal Holineſs,</hi> or any other <hi>Indiſcernable Qualification</hi> in Infants; the Scripture is altogether ſilent therein.</p>
            <p>His Fifth Argument for Infants Baptiſm, is derived from <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39. <hi>Repent and be Baptized every one of you, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt for the Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For the Promiſe is unio you, and to your Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall Call.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whatever Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> or others ſuppoſe, Firſt it is Evident that the <hi>Promiſe</hi> here ſpoken of, is not to be underſtood of a Promiſe of <hi>External</hi> Priviledges, but the <hi>Promiſe of the Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>the Grace of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> which was now freely held forth unto them upon their Repentance, notwithſtanding they had been the Actual Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of the <hi>Lord of Glory,</hi> which he had before charged upon them; which only could be a <hi>Suitable Plaiſter</hi> for the <hi>Wound</hi> now given them thereby; telling them that they might have <hi>Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> even of that Sin, if they did <hi>Repent:</hi> Becauſe, beyond and contrary to their Acting, in Crucifying Chriſt, God had brought to paſs the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up of Chriſt for their Salvation, and <hi>their Children, and all</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:50207:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>whom God ſhould Call,</hi> though a far off, if they alſo did Repent, and were Baptized into the Name of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Nor indeed, Secondly, was the Promiſe to their Children, as <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Seed;</hi> nor to them or any other <hi>uncalled</hi> by the Lord; But with this expreſs Proviſo; <hi>Even as many as the Lord our God ſhall Call.</hi> Which calling alone made them Chriſts, and capable of Baptiſm. Nor are the Words, <hi>To you and your Children,</hi> mentioned as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of a Priviledge to them <hi>before others;</hi> but by reaſon of their Wiſh. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 25. <hi>His Blood be on us, and on our Children:</hi> And ſo as a Remedy of their Perplexity, v. 37. <hi>When they heard this they were pricked to their Heart,</hi> &amp;c. Nor is any Intimation given of a Title <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to them, or their Children <hi>as the Children of Believers,</hi> but an Exhortation to them and theirs to Repent and be Baptized, as their <hi>duty</hi> for their benefit; The Promiſe being not mentioned, as though <hi>of it ſelf</hi> it gave a <hi>Title</hi> to Baptiſm, either to them, or to their Off-ſpring, without <hi>Repentance:</hi> But as a <hi>Motive</hi> why both they and theirs ſhould actually Repent, and be Baptiſed; becauſe in ſo doing they would be in the way of obtaining the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their Sins,</hi> and <hi>Receiving the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the two grand Branches of the Promiſe here mentioned: Which duty of <hi>Repentance,</hi> Little Children being uncapable of performing, neither are they therefore, according to this direction of the Apoſtle, the <hi>proper Subjects</hi> of ſuch an Ordinance. So that this Text is groſly abuſed by ſuch as infer from thence, a Title to Baptiſm for the <hi>Children</hi> of Believers, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a Promiſe to them, <hi>as ſuch;</hi> Whereas it is manifeſt from the whole Scope of the Con-text; that it is only an Encouragement to the Jews againſt <hi>Deſpair,</hi> by reaſon of their Crucifying of Chriſt; Letting them know, that yet there was hope of Mercy and of Pardon for <hi>them,</hi> and <hi>theirs,</hi> upon the Reſpective Repentance of <hi>either</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>A Sixth Argument for Infants Baptiſm is drawn from <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>In whom alſo you are Circumciſed with the Circumciſion made without Hands, in putting off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh by the Circumciſion of Chriſt.</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>Buried with him in Baptiſm, wherein you are alſo riſen with him, through the Faith of the Operation of God, who hath raiſed him from the Dead.</hi> From whence a groundleſs Inference is drawn, concerning the Succeſſion of Chriſtian <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> into the Room, Place, and Uſe of Jewiſh <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> And that therefore, as the Jewiſh Infants were <hi>Circumciſed,</hi> ſo by way of <hi>Analogy,</hi> thoſe Born of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Parents ought to be <hi>Baptiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this We Anſwer; Firſt, That to ſuppoſe that <hi>Chriſtian Baptiſm</hi> comes in the Room, Place, or Uſe of <hi>Jewiſh Circumciſion,</hi> is a miſtaken Inference, which can neither be truly drawn from thoſe Words of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Colloſſians,</hi> nor from any other place of Scripture.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50207:21"/> Not from the preſent Words, where no Circumſion <hi>in the Fleſh</hi> is at all <hi>Expreſſed,</hi> or can be <hi>meant,</hi> but that of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> in his own <hi>Perſon;</hi> which is there made the Exemplary Efficient of <hi>Spiritual Circumciſion:</hi> for ſo it is expreſly told us. <hi>In whom alſo you are Circumciſed with the Circumciſion made without Hands, in putting off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh, by the Circumciſion of Chriſt.</hi> So that this Text avails nothing at all to the preſent purpoſe; it being e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>dent that the Scope of the Spirit of God there, is to ſhew that <hi>we are compleat in Chriſt.</hi> v. 10. And to this purpoſe he Subjoyns. v. 12. <hi>Buried with Him in Baptiſm, wherein ye are alſo riſen with Him, through the Faith of the Operation of God.</hi> But whereas we are told that the Jewiſh Teachers would be ready to Object, that the receiving of the <hi>Inward Grace</hi> of Circumciſion did not make them ſo compleat as <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed was, becauſe they had alſo an <hi>Outward Viſible Sign.</hi> This is a groundleſs Conceit that either the Jews were ready thus to <hi>Object,</hi> or that the Apoſtle intended to <hi>Anſwer</hi> ſuch an Objection: But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it were ſo, Doth it therefore follow that becauſe the <hi>Jewiſh Infants</hi> were Circumciſed, therefore <hi>ours</hi> muſt be Baptized? Is there a Syllable of that ſound or ſignification in the Text? For it is plain that the Apoſtle is not there ſpeaking of <hi>Infants,</hi> but concerning <hi>Adult Believers</hi> only; nor can it with any ſhadow of Reaſon be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is appointed to have the ſame Place, and Uſe in the Church of God that <hi>Circumciſion</hi> had: For if ſo then it would alſo follow, that <hi>Females</hi> muſt be Excluded from <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> becauſe uncapable of <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> And that becauſe Circumciſion bound Men to keep the whole Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> therefore ſo doth Baptiſm alſo. And indeed, to affirm that there is the ſame Ground for Infant Baptiſm, as for Infant Circumciſion, is to aſſert that the command of Circumciſion is Obligatory to us. And to Imagine that there is a Parity of Reaſon from <hi>Analogy</hi> or <hi>Proportion</hi> between them, is no other than a groundleſs Suppoſition, that there is a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of them to direct us in their Uſe, beſides what God hath <hi>expreſly declard unto us;</hi> and to ſay, That tho Chriſt and His Apoſtles have not <hi>told</hi> us ſo; yet we <hi>think</hi> it ſhould be ſo, is to Impute <hi>a defect</hi> in them of what they <hi>ſhould</hi> have done, and more <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Diligence</hi> in our ſelves about Ordering the Divine Service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We can fetch</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his late <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of <hi>Epiſcopacy) no Model of a Goſpel Miniſtry, nor proof of our Authority or Obligation as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, from the Inſtituted Miniſtry of the Moſaical Church: Becauſe the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>is Abrogate, and indeed did never bind the Gentiles. Nor is it ſafe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to Argue from Parity of Reaſon, that we muſt now be, or do, as they did, in point of pure Inſtitution, while we ſo little know the total Reaſon of God's Inſtitutions. And when He Himſelf hath taken</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:50207:22"/> 
               <hi>them down and ſet up new Ones, we muſt not then plead our Reaſon againſt the Alterations which God Himſelf hath made.</hi> P. 29. Beſides which.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Argument from <hi>Circumciſion</hi> is invalid upon many Conſiderations; For Figures and Types prove nothing, unleſs a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> go a long with them, or ſome <hi>Expreſs</hi> to ſignifie ſuch to be their purpoſe: For the Deluge of Waters, and the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> were a Figure of Baptiſm, ſaid <hi>Peter:</hi> And if the Circumſtances of the one ſhould be drawn to the other, we ſhould make Baptiſm a <hi>Prodigy</hi> rather than a <hi>Rite.</hi> The Feaſt of the <hi>Paſſover</hi> was a Type of the <hi>Supper,</hi> which ſucceeds the other as much as <hi>Baptiſm</hi> doth to <hi>Circumciſion:</hi> But becauſe there was in the eating of the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> no preſcription of <hi>Sacramental Drink,</hi> ſhall we thence Conclude, that the Supper is to be Adminiſtred but in <hi>one kind?</hi> Or, that becauſe the <hi>Paſſover</hi> was to be eaten in <hi>haſte,</hi> with a Staff in their Hand; Muſt we thence conclude, that the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> ought to be ſo Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated alſo? No, we will eaſily conclude that we are duly to attend unto the Words of the Inſtitution, which particularly concerns the right Celebration of that Ordinance of the <hi>Supper,</hi> whatever Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were by the command of God to be Obſerved in the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the <hi>Type.</hi> And after the ſame ſort muſt we Reaſon, if we will Reaſon aright, concerning <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm</hi> alſo. And yet again,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Even in the very Inſtance of this Argument; Suppoſing a Coreſpondency of <hi>Analogy,</hi> between Circumciſion and Baptiſm; yet there is no Correſpondency of <hi>Identity.</hi> For although it were granted that both of them did Conſign the <hi>Covenant of Faith;</hi> yet there is nothing in the <hi>Circumſtance</hi> of Childrens being Circumciſed, that ſo concerns that Myſtery, but that it might very well be given to <hi>Children,</hi> and yet Baptiſm only to <hi>men of Reaſon:</hi> Becauſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion <hi>left</hi> a character in the <hi>fleſh,</hi> which being Imprinted upon <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi> did its work to them when they came of <hi>Age.</hi> And ſuch a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter was neceſſary, becauſe there was no <hi>word</hi> added to the ſign: But Baptiſm Imprints nothing that remains on the Body, and if it leaves a character at all, it is upon the <hi>Soul,</hi> to which alſo the <hi>word</hi> is added, which is as much a part of the Ordinance as the <hi>Sign</hi> it ſelf. For which cauſe therefore it is highly requiſite that the Parties Baptized ſhould be <hi>capable of Reaſon,</hi> that they may be capable both of the <hi>word of the Ordinance,</hi> and the <hi>Impreſs</hi> to be made thereby upon the <hi>Soul.</hi> Since therefore the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of the Parity doth wholly fail, there is left nothing to Infer a Neceſſity of Complying in this Circumſtance of <hi>Age</hi> more then in the other <hi>Annexes</hi> of the Type. Then alſo the Infant muſt be preciſely baptized upon the <hi>Eighth day;</hi> And <hi>Females</hi> muſt not be baptized, becauſe ſuch were not to be Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed. But it were more proper if we would underſtand it aright, to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50207:22"/> proſecute the Analogy from the <hi>type</hi> to the Antitype, by way of <hi>letter</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Signification.</hi> That as Circumciſion figures Baptiſm; ſo alſo the Adjuncts of the Circumciſion, ſhall ſignifie ſome thing <hi>Spiritual,</hi> in the <hi>Adherences</hi> of Baptiſm. And therefore as <hi>Infants</hi> were Circumciſed; So <hi>Spiritual</hi> Infants ſhall be Baptized, which is Spiritual Circumciſion. For therefore <hi>Babes</hi> had the Miniſtry of the <hi>type,</hi> to Signifie that we muſt, when we give our Names to Chriſt, become <hi>Children in Malice</hi> and then the type is made Compleat.</p>
            <p>The Seventh Argument for Infants Baptiſm, and whereon the greateſt ſtreſs is laid, by Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> Mr <hi>Baxter,</hi> and others; is drawn from the <hi>Church-member-ſhip of Infants</hi> under the former Adminiſtration. That becauſe Infants were comprehended with their Parents in the <hi>Jews Church</hi> ſtate; they are ſo ſtill under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and therefore to <hi>be</hi> baptized.</p>
            <p>Reply. We know very well that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and others, do Aſſert the Church-memberſhip of Infants <hi>before Abrahams time;</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a <hi>Moral</hi> Inſtitution, and ſo not Capable of being <hi>Repealed</hi> as other Jewiſh Rites were. But that is a <hi>groundleſs Fiction,</hi> and cannot be at all proved from the Scripture: The Diſcuſſion whereof ſhall be reſerved for the latter part of this Diſcourſe. In the mean ſeaſon, That they were admitted Members of the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> is Evident. And it is alſo as Evident that God hath now quite pulled down <hi>that Houſe</hi> of his, broke up Houſe-keeping, and turned the Servants, Infants, and all out of Doors, Rom. 11. 17. 24. <hi>The Natural Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are broken of,</hi> and God hath now built him a New houſe into which God hath admitted none as his Houſhold Servants but <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi> only, or ſuch as <hi>Profeſs</hi> ſo to be. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 5. 9. <hi>was faithfull as a Servant in all his houſe: But Chriſt as a ſon over his own Houſe: Whoſe Houſe are we, if we hold faſt the Confidence, &amp;c.</hi> Where the Servants of the new houſe, are diſcribed te be <hi>Beleivers, not Infants,</hi> and therefore called <hi>Living ſtones and a Spiritual Houſe.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3. And that the Old Houſe, the Jewiſh Church, with all the Appurtenances and Priviledges of it, is pulled down, and a new One Built, into which Infants are not to be admitted, is Evident from the Apoſtles Reaſoning. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>For the Prieſthood being changed, there is made of neceſſity a change alſo of the Law.</hi> Which muſt needs Include Circumciſion with all the Appurtenances and Priviledges belonging to it. And therefore, as Infants Church-memberſhip <hi>came in</hi> with the Law of Circumciſion, So it <hi>went out</hi> and was repealed with it. They <hi>were</hi> tis true of the Houſhold <hi>of Old,</hi> but it was by a <hi>poſitive Law.</hi> Shew us the like <hi>now,</hi> or you ſay nothing? Sure it is, There is now no Inſtitution that makes Infants <hi>fellow Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God,</hi> neither are they to bo ſo accounted till they <hi>believe</hi> and are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50207:23"/> able to do <hi>Service</hi> in the Houſe. And if you ſay, that among men Infants are counted of the Houſhold tho they can do no Service: we Anſwer; that as Compariſons do not run upon four feet: ſo it doth not follow that becauſe we count our Infants of our Family, therefore they are to be accounted members of Gods Family, the Goſpel Church, unleſs God by any Inſtitution had made them ſo. The Houſhold of God is called the <hi>Houſhold of faith,</hi> or a Houſe Conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Believers.</hi> Now unleſs you can prove Infants to be <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> they are not of this Houſe: For all the Servants here muſt be Believers; either <hi>Really,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>hiſtorically</hi> and <hi>Profeſſedly,</hi> which Infants cannot be.</p>
            <p>If it be Objected, That as the Jews and their Children are broken off: So the Gentiles and their Children are Ingraffed in their Room, according to Rom. 11. 20. <hi>Becauſe of unbelief they were broken off; and thou ſtandeſt by faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We Anſwer, That the Reaſon why the Jews and their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren were broken off, was not becauſe they had not <hi>Believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents:</hi> For <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob</hi> were <hi>ſtill</hi> the Parents of them all. They were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed when they were broken off) as well as before: But the true Reaſon was becauſe the terms of ſtanding in the Church were now <hi>altered.</hi> For before the Goſpel came, they ſtood <hi>members</hi> of the Old <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, though as much <hi>unbelievers,</hi> for many Generations, as they were when they were broken off. But now <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Church ſtate is at an end, and all the Priviledges and Immunities ceaſe. The Jewiſh Church muſt give way to the Goſpel Church; The Meſſiah being come, and about to build him a New Houſe, into which none are of Right to enter, but ſuch as are <hi>profeſt Believers:</hi> For the Old Houſe or Jewiſh Church was not intended to abide <hi>for ever,</hi> but only to the time of <hi>Reformation.</hi> And then the <hi>Law</hi> muſt be changed, the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> changed, the <hi>Priviledges</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> changed, yea the <hi>Covenant</hi> changed: Which they not believing, being willing to abide in the Old Houſe ſtill, and to remain Church Members upon the account of a meer <hi>Fleſhly</hi> and <hi>Natural Birth,</hi> ſtill crying out, <hi>Abraham is our Father, and we are his Seed,</hi> and are <hi>Free, and were never in Bondage:</hi> Wherefore they were broken off, and that whether they would or not, by reaſon of their <hi>unbelief,</hi> that is, becauſe they would not believe that the Old Covenant, and all the Priviledges thereof were <hi>ended,</hi> and the Subſtance come, the Lord Jeſus, who was the true <hi>Antitype,</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> of all theſe Shadows. So that thus then, the Jews were then broken off by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief;</hi> And thou and thine (O! Gentile Believer) muſt <hi>ſtand by Faith:</hi> Mark it, thou ſtandeſt by Faith; not by Virtue of any <hi>Birth Priviledge</hi> whatſoever, but thy ſtanding is by <hi>Faith;</hi> yet not thy Seed by <hi>thy</hi> Faith, but thou thy
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50207:23"/> ſelf by <hi>thine,</hi> and they by their <hi>own. Faith</hi> is that by which (thou ſtanding and not thy Seed) haſt right to ſtand in the Church, and not they. But if thy Seed have Faith, and thou haſt none, they have right to ſtand in the Church, and thou ſhalt be Excluded.</p>
            <p>Moſt certain it is, that under the Law the Natural Seed or Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Abraham</hi> were all Holy, with an External, Ceremonial, or Typical Holineſs, and conſequently they were then all admitted to an External Participation of Church Priviledges. But remarkable to this purpoſe is that paſſage of the Apoſtle. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore henceforth know we no Man after the Fleſh.</hi> It ſeems then, that heretofore, there had been a <hi>knowledge</hi> taken of Perſons after the <hi>Fleſh.</hi> And 'tis plain there was, that becauſe the Jews were of the <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Fleſhly</hi> Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they were therefore all of them admitted to the Priviledge of an <hi>External</hi> Church-memberſhip, while others were Exempted. But we ſee the Apoſtle reſolves <hi>henceforth</hi> to diſclaim any ſuch <hi>Cogniſance</hi> of them, or any others, upon the Account of a meer <hi>Fleſhly</hi> Deſcent. And to this very purpoſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſubjoins in the following Verſe. <hi>Therefore if any Man be in Chriſt he is a new Creature: Old things are paſt away, all things are become New:</hi> A new Church State, and new Ordinances, a new Seed. and a new way of Introduction, unto the Participation of the Priviledge of Church-memberſhip under the Goſpel Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Now nothing but a <hi>New Creature</hi> will ſerve the turn; for God expects that they that Worſhip him now, do <hi>Worſhip Him in Spirit and in Truth;</hi> The <hi>Priviledge</hi> of being admitted into God's Houſe, and to ſtand before His Preſence in the Actual Celebration of Goſpel Ordinances, being now Entailed only upon the Spiritual Seed, even ſuch who <hi>as lively Stones are built up a Spiritual Houſe, a Holy Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to offer up Spiritual Sacrifices acceptable to God, by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 1. Pet. 2. 3. 4. Or ſuch at leaſt as make a viſible Profeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>And therefore, when this New, and more Spiritual Diſpenſation was now about actually to be Introduced into the World; <hi>John,</hi> who was the Harbinger of it, gives ſufficient notice thereof, and to this purpoſe deals plainly with the Jews, the Phariſees and the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces that came to be Baptized of him; And tells them upon this Account, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Think not to ſay within your Selves, We have</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>to our Father: For I ſay unto you that God is able of theſe Stones to raiſe up Children unto</hi> Abraham. <hi>And now alſo the Axe is laid unto tho Root of the Trees; therefore every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewn down and caſt into the Fire.</hi> It cannot be denied but that they had <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father as much now as before; only the <hi>terms</hi> of their ſtanding in the Church were <hi>now changed:</hi> So that now <hi>every Tree</hi> of whatſoever Natural Stock, or External Production,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50207:24"/> 
               <hi>that bringeth not forth good Fruit muſt be hewn down.</hi> And the Reaſon is rendered for that <hi>Now the Ax is laid unto the Root of the Trees.</hi> Mark it, <hi>[Now]</hi> 'tis ſo; It was not ſo <hi>before.</hi> The Ax was never 'till <hi>now</hi> laid at the <hi>Root</hi> of the Trees; which muſt needs be underſtood in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to that <hi>Birth Priviledge</hi> before ſpoken of, which they had ſo long boaſted of, as the whole Context ſhews. But now God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make other manner of Work of it, under the Goſpel Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation than he did before. Now the <hi>Root of the Trees</hi> muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levelled at. A bare <hi>natural</hi> Deſcent, or Extraction from a <hi>Religious Root,</hi> will not now ſerve turn, as in times paſt it did, to give any right or title to <hi>Church Priviledges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas therefore Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> doth endeavour to demonſtrate that the Jewiſh Church was as Pure and Spiritual in its Frame and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution as that of the Goſpel, it doth from hence moſt plainly appear that there is a vaſt difference between them, in reſpect of the manner of their Conſtitution, or the terms upon which the Members of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were to be admitted. And as there is no particular Perſon in the World, whether before or ſince, that can pretend unto the like <hi>Priviledge,</hi> or Prerogative as <hi>Abraham</hi> had, to be <hi>the Father of the Faithful;</hi> whoſe <hi>Natural Seed alſo</hi> were dignified with many <hi>External</hi> Priviledges: So the Diſpenſation being now <hi>changed,</hi> and the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that <hi>once</hi> belonged unto <hi>Abraham's Natural Seed</hi> being now <hi>Repealed,</hi> or rather expired: There is therefore no juſt claim that hence-forth can be duly made unto any other of a like ſignification under the Goſpel, by the <hi>Natural Poſterity</hi> of any Believer whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but ſuch alone as are found actually bearing and bringing forth the ſame Fruits of Faith and Holineſs that <hi>Abraham</hi> did, or ſuch at leaſt as make a <hi>viſible Profeſſion</hi> of the ſame.</p>
            <p>As for the latter part of Mr <hi>Allen's</hi> Diſcourſe, Wherein he labours to prove the Lawfulneſs of <hi>Impoſing</hi> other Ceremonies in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of God's Worſhip, beſide what himſelf hath appointed. In order to the Refutation of this Aſſertion of his, there needs no more to be done than attentively to give heed unto the Words of the Commiſſion given by Chriſt to his Apoſtles, and in them, unto all true Church Guides, or Governours unto the end of the World; to this purpoſe; as it is Recorded. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. 20. <hi>Go Teach all Nations.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Teaching them to Obſerve all things whatſoever I have Commanded you, and lo I am with you alway, &amp;c.</hi> Where we are to Note, that he ſaith not that they ſhould teach them to Obſerve all things in the matters of his Worſhip which the <hi>Church Governours ſhould hereafter Judge Decent or Convenient:</hi> But <hi>whatſoever I have Comanded.</hi> that is either by himſelf or his Apoſtles. Which words muſt of neceſſity be Excluſive of all <hi>humane Inventions,</hi> or Additions to the Worſhip of God; For that he hath frequently diſcovered his ſevereſt Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50207:24"/> againſt his People of Old, for their Preſumption in <hi>adding</hi> thoſe things to His Worſhip which He <hi>Commanded not.</hi> A Lively Inſtance whereof we have in the Caſe of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> in their Offering up of <hi>ſtrange Fire, Lev.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3, The Puniſhment Inflicted on whom was not for doing what was <hi>Expreſly forbidden;</hi> but for their <hi>Preſumption</hi> in doing that which God had <hi>not Commanded.</hi> In Matters purely <hi>Civil,</hi> 'tis true, We are to <hi>Submit to Every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's Sake;</hi> and that even in ſuch things as are <hi>not expreſly Commanded,</hi> provided they be not ſome way or other <hi>forbidden</hi> in the Word. But as for the matters of <hi>God's Worſhip,</hi> We have no ſuch Rule, but rather the contrary: <hi>Render therefore to</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things which are</hi> Caeſar's; <hi>and unto</hi> GOD, <hi>the things that are</hi> GOD's. Mat. 22. 21. God having above all things expreſſed His Jealouſie concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, and hath frequently given Teſtimonies of his ſevereſt Diſpleaſure againſt His People becauſe of their <hi>Preſumptuous Additions</hi> thereunto. Witneſs. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 32. and 18. 20. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 6. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. 8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>Exod.</hi> 39. 43. And among the reſt to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; Remarkable is that Reprehenſion given by our Saviour unto the Scribes and Phariſees; when he tells them that their Worſhip of this kind was but <hi>vain Worſhip. Mark</hi> 7. 7. 8. <hi>Howbeit, in vain do they Worſhip me, Teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men. For laying aſide the Commandment of God, ye hold the Tradition of Men, as the waſhing of Pots and Cups; and many other ſuch like things yee do. And he ſaid unto them,</hi> ver. 9. <hi>Full well ye reject the Commandment of God, that ye may keep your own Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither indeed is there any Power on Earth that hath Authority ſufficient to <hi>Innovate,</hi> or <hi>Inſtitute</hi> any thing in the Worſhip of God; the higheſt Government that Chriſt hath ordained in His Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but of a <hi>Subordinate</hi> and <hi>Miniſterial</hi> Property; and therefore not <hi>Abſolute,</hi> but <hi>limited</hi> in its Commands by <hi>the Word of God.</hi> Deut. 12. 32. <hi>Whatſoever I command you, Obſerve to do it, thou ſhalt not add thereunto nor diminiſh from it.</hi> Deut. 18. 20. <hi>The Prophet that ſhall ſpeak a Word in my Name, that I have not commanded, even that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſhall Dye.</hi> Ezek. 43. 7, 8. <hi>Son of Man, the place of my Throne, and the place of the Soles of my Feet, where I will dwell in the midſt of the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>for ever; and my Holy Name ſhall the Houſe of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>no more defile, neither they nor their Kings, by their Whoredom, nor by the Carkaſes of their Kings in their high Places; In their ſetting of their Threſhold by my Threſholds, and their Poſt by my Poſts.</hi> In the Work of the Tabernacle of Old nothing was to be <hi>Superadded,</hi> but what God had <hi>Expreſsly appointed.</hi> Exod. 39. 43. And the Reaſon is the ſame in the Goſpel Miniſtration.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:50207:25"/>
            <p> But by way of Oppoſition hereunto, is that general direction of the Apoſtle urged, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 40. <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order.</hi> From whence it is Inferred that whatſoever Church Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſhall <hi>Judge decent</hi> and <hi>orderly</hi> in God's Worſhip, ought to be ſubmitted unto.</p>
            <p>We Anſwer; That this cannot be juſtly Inferred from theſe Words for the following Reaſons.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Firſt,</hi> To Worſhip GOD in a way that is <hi>not decent</hi> and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly</hi> according to <hi>Scripture Rule,</hi> is manifeſtly our Sin. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. But to Worſhip Him in the uſe of thoſe enjoyned Ceremonies, is to Worſhip Him in a way <hi>not decent</hi> and <hi>orderly</hi> according to <hi>Scripture Rule,</hi> Therefore ſo to do would be manifeſtly our Sin.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved; the <hi>Minor</hi> is thus proved.</p>
            <p>If to Worſhip GOD in the uſe of ſuch Ceremonies be decent and orderly according to <hi>Scripture Rule;</hi> then to Worſhip Him <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> ſuch Ceremonies is <hi>not</hi> to Worſhip GOD <hi>decently</hi> and <hi>orderly,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Scripture Rule:</hi> For one Rule cannot make the ſame Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, decent and undecent, orderly and diſorderly.</p>
            <p>But to Worſhip Him <hi>without</hi> the uſe of theſe Ceremonies is to Worſhip Him <hi>decently</hi> and <hi>orderly,</hi> according to <hi>Scripture Rule;</hi> the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians Worſhiping Him decently and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly without them; <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Containing a Diſtinct and more Particular Conſideration of the Arguments drawn from</hi> Rom. 11. 16, 17. <hi>Together with all other the moſt Material Arguments which are uſually urged for the Support of</hi> Infants Baptiſm.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE ſhall begin with thoſe Arguments which are drawn from <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16, 17. Where the Apoſtle tells us; That <hi>if the Firſt Fruit be Holy, the Lump is alſo Holy. And if the Root be Holy ſo are the Branches. And if ſome of the Branches be broken off, and thou being a Wild Olive Tree wert graffed in among them, and with them partakeſt of the Root and Fatneſs, of the Olive Tree, boaſt not againſt the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> &amp;c. From whence 'tis urged; That We Gentiles have now the ſame Graffing into the true Olive which the Jews formerly had; and that <hi>our graffing</hi> is Anſwerable to <hi>their preſent Caſting out.</hi> Now when they were taken in, they and their <hi>Children</hi> were taken in. When they were broken off, they and their <hi>Children</hi> were broken off. And therefore if our graffing in be anſwerable to theirs, We and <hi>our Children</hi> are graffed in together.</p>
            <p>To this we Reply; That the <hi>Inciſion,</hi> or <hi>Ingraffing</hi> here Spoken of, may be either into the <hi>Viſible,</hi> or <hi>Inviſible</hi> Church. The graffing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50207:28"/> in may be either by <hi>Faith,</hi> or by <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of Faith, or by Some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinance. Children may be either <hi>grown Men,</hi> or <hi>Infants.</hi> The graffing in may be either <hi>certain</hi> or <hi>probable. Certain,</hi> either by reaſon of <hi>Election,</hi> the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> made unto them, or their <hi>Natural birth,</hi> being Children of Believers. <hi>Probable,</hi> as being <hi>likely,</hi> either becauſe <hi>frequently,</hi> or for the moſt part it <hi>happens</hi> ſo; though not <hi>neceſſary</hi> and ſo <hi>not certain.</hi> The thing that is to be proved is; <hi>That all the Infants of every Believer, are in the Covenant of Free Grace in Chriſt, and by Virtue thereof to be Baptized into the Communion of the Viſible Church.</hi> Now it may be granted that Infants of Believers are <hi>frequently</hi> or for the <hi>moſt part</hi> under the Election and Covenant of Grace, and ſo in the <hi>Inviſihle</hi> Church (which whether it be ſo or no, no meer Man can tell) And yet it not follow that <hi>every Infant of a Believer,</hi> in as much as he is the Child of a Believer, is under the Covenant of Grace, and therefore by Baptiſm is to be admitted into the <hi>viſible Church.</hi> Now let it be never ſo <hi>probable</hi> that God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues His Election in the <hi>Poſterity of Believers,</hi> and accordingly hath promiſed to be their God in the Covenant of Grace; yet if this be the Rule of Baptizing, then <hi>the Infants of Believers only</hi> and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are to be Baptized: For the <hi>Practice</hi> muſt agree with the <hi>Rule.</hi> And ſo not <hi>all</hi> Infants of Believers neither, are to be Baptized, but the <hi>Elect</hi> in the Covenant of Grace only. If it be ſaid, But we are to Judge <hi>all</hi> to be Elected, and in the Covenant of Grace, 'till the contrary appears. We Anſwer, That we are not to Judge <hi>all to be Elected,</hi> or in the Covenant of Grace, becauſe we have the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of GOD's Mind to the contrary. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 8. And all Experience proves the contrary to be true. Nor is the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Outward Ordinance, Inſtituted by God according to ſuch a Rule as is <hi>not poſſible to be known;</hi> but according to that which is <hi>manifeſt</hi> to the Miniſters of it. And therefore ſince God conceals His Purpoſe of <hi>Election,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> which is Congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to it, in reſpect of the <hi>Perſons Elected;</hi> It is certain God would not have <hi>this</hi> the Rule according to which outward Ordinances are to be Adminiſtred.</p>
            <p>But it is Urged, That our Graffing into the Olive Tree, the Church, is Anſwerable to that of the Jews. Now their Infants were Graffed in by <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and therefore ours are to be Graffed in by <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reply. Can we indeed think that the Apoſtle here means by Graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing in, <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> or <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> or an Inciſion by an <hi>outward</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? If that were the meaning, then breaking off muſt be meant of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſing,</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbaptizing.</hi> The whole Context ſpeaks of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50207:28"/> the <hi>Election</hi> of ſome, and the <hi>Rejection</hi> of others: Of the <hi>Breaking off by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> and the <hi>Standing by Faith:</hi> And therefore the Graffing muſt be meant of the Inviſible Church, by <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Faith;</hi> which Inviſible Church was firſt among the Jews, and therefore called <hi>the Olive,</hi> out of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Root, who is therefore ſaid to <hi>bear them.</hi> And becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> had a double Capacity; one of a <hi>Natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and the other of <hi>the Father of the Faithful:</hi> In reſpect of his <hi>former</hi> Capacity, ſome are called <hi>Branches according to Nature.</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his <hi>latter</hi> Capacity, others are called <hi>Wild Olives by Nature,</hi> yet Graffed in <hi>by Faith.</hi> And therefore when it is ſaid that ſome of <hi>the Natural Branches were broken off,</hi> the meaning is not, that ſome of the Branches in the <hi>Inviſible Church</hi> may be broken off: But it is plainly to be underſtood in reference to the <hi>Natural Branches</hi> only; that is, of ſuch alone who had nothing but their <hi>Natural Pedigree,</hi> or deſcent from <hi>Abraham</hi> as a <hi>Natural Father</hi> to inſiſt upon. And in this reſpect it is expreſly told us, that <hi>ſome</hi> of the Natural Branches only were broken off: For <hi>ſome of them</hi> were Branches in <hi>both reſpects,</hi> and accordingly were <hi>not broken off;</hi> but we Believing Gentiles are ſaid to be <hi>Graffed in amongſt them,</hi> and <hi>with them are partakers of the Root and Fatneſs of the Olive Tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you ſay then, that <hi>the Gentiles have now the ſame Graffing into the true Olive, which tho Jews formerly had;</hi> We muſt Remember that known and allowed Diſtinction, Concerning the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Covenant, and the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of it. Now it is true that in reſpect of the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Covenant, we have the ſame Graffing in to the Olive, the Church of the Faithful, of which <hi>Abraham</hi> is the Root, that the Believing Jews had: And ſo we by Faith are ſaid to be made <hi>Partakers of the Root and Fatneſs of the Olive Tree:</hi> Or in plainer Terms, as the Apoſtle Phraſeth it. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>We are now made Fellow Heirs, and of the ſame Body, and partakers of his Promiſe in Chriſt, through the Goſpel.</hi> In reſpect of which all <hi>Believing</hi> Gentiles are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Seed, the Iſrael of God, One in Chriſt.</hi> But if you mean it of the <hi>Outward</hi> Adminiſtration of this Ingraffing, by <hi>Circumciſion</hi> or <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> nothing is more untrue: For indeed the <hi>Outward Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration</hi> which then was, is utterly taken away, removed, and changed; It being that which whilſt it ſtood was the Ground of a Separation between the Jews and the Gentiles. And it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taken away on this very purpoſe, that the <hi>Enmity</hi> betwixt <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> might be removed, and they made <hi>One in Chriſt</hi> by his Death.</p>
            <p>And if you ſay that <hi>our preſent Graffing In muſt be anſwerable to their preſent Caſting Out.</hi> It is true, our preſent Graffing In, is anſwerable to their (or rather for their) Caſting out. That is, GOD would ſupply in His Olive Tree the Church, <hi>the caſting away of the Jews,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:50207:29"/> by the <hi>Calling of the Gentiles,</hi> who are now by Faith Graffed in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Remaining Believing Jews,</hi> who continued as yet unbroken off: But it doth not therefore follow that the <hi>Infants of Believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> are Graffed In together with <hi>themſelves,</hi> as the <hi>Jewiſh Infants</hi> were; becauſe uncapable of making that Profeſſion of Faith which the Goſpel now requires.</p>
            <p>But it is further Urged, that if the <hi>Fruit be Holy, the Lump is alſo Holy. And if the Root be Holy, ſo are the Branches</hi> As for that of the <hi>Root,</hi> it is variouſly Conceived by Interpreters, ſome underſtanding thereby the <hi>Covenant</hi> to be meant; ſome <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob;</hi> and ſome <hi>Abraham only;</hi> which laſt, in its proper Senſe, I Conceive to be moſt Genuine. Whereas therefore the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>the firſt Fruit is Holy;</hi> the <hi>Lump Holy, The Root Holy,</hi> and <hi>the Branches Holy:</hi> From whence ſome would Infer a <hi>derivative</hi> Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the Parents to the Children; that is, the Father being Holy, and accepted in Covenant with GOD, the Children are ſo too, <hi>being Beloved for the Fathers Sake.</hi> The Truth is, the Holineſs the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, is Firſt in reſpect of GOD's Election, <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Perſonal;</hi> and <hi>Inherent</hi> in GOD's Intention. <hi>He hath choſen us, that we ſhould be Holy.</hi> Eph. 1. 4. Secondly, It is alſo Holineſs <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivative</hi> or deſcending, but not from any Anceſtors but from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> only; and that not as a <hi>Natural,,</hi> but as a <hi>Spiritual Father,</hi> or <hi>the Father of the Faithful,</hi> wherein he was a Lively Image or Figure of Chriſt Himſelf; and is derived from the Covenant of Grace which paſſed in his Name to him and to his Seed. And Laſtly, It ſhall be <hi>Inherent,</hi> being <hi>actually</hi> Communicated by the Spirit of GOD, when they ſhall be <hi>actually</hi> Called. And this is ſuch a kind of Holineſs, as is more than a bare <hi>Adherent</hi> or <hi>Relative Holineſs;</hi> being alſo <hi>inherent</hi> by Faith, whereby they are Holy as the Root is Holy.</p>
            <p>Now whereas you underſtand it to be the Caſe of <hi>any Believers</hi> to be a <hi>Holy Root</hi> to their <hi>Poſterity:</hi> This is not true: For in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Reſemblance, <hi>Abraham only is a Holy Root,</hi> in whoſe Name the Covenant runs: No other Man, though a Believer, being the Father <hi>of the Faithful</hi> but <hi>Abraham only;</hi> And the whole Body of Believers is compared to <hi>the Olive,</hi> and each Believer to a <hi>Branch</hi> that partakes of the <hi>Root and Fatneſs of the Olive Tree;</hi> not in <hi>outward</hi> Diſpenſations only, but in <hi>Saving Graces</hi> alſo; which indeed is mainly here intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For it cannot rationally be Suppoſed that by <hi>the Fatneſs of the Olive Tree</hi> we are to underſtand any <hi>External Priviledge</hi> whatſoever in its ſelf, belonging to us or ours: For that of it ſelf would be but a <hi>dry,</hi> a <hi>barren,</hi> and a <hi>ſapleſs</hi> Advantage: But by the Fatneſs of the Olive Tree, we are certainly to underſtand that <hi>Spiritual Benefit</hi> and Advantage that <hi>from Chriſt</hi> is to be Communicated or Derived unto us, who was indeed herein Repreſented by <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50207:29"/> this purpoſe therefore called <hi>the Friend of God,</hi> and the <hi>Father of the Faithful:</hi> And whoſe Prerogative herein no other Man, though a Believer, whether before or ſince, could ever juſtly pretend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>But whereas it is yet further Urged; That the Church of the Jews, and that of the Gentiles is <hi>ſtill the ſame;</hi> that is, It is ſtill the ſame Viſible Church now, that it was then. And ſo much (ſay you) the Apoſtles Simile or Metaphor of Ingraffing will bear, or it ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And if the <hi>viſible Church</hi> be the ſame, Why ſhould not the <hi>Subjects</hi> be the ſame, <hi>viz. Children,</hi> and the <hi>Priviledge</hi> be the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>External Badge</hi> and <hi>Cogniſance</hi> given to the <hi>Children</hi> of the Church <hi>now,</hi> as well as under the <hi>Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We Anſwer; That true it is, the Church of the Jews and that of the Gentiles is one and the ſame, in reference to the true <hi>Eſſence,</hi> or Inward <hi>Subſtance</hi> of either: In which reſpect, as we have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Believing Gentiles (according to the Apoſtles Metaphor) are here ſaid to be <hi>Graffed in amongſt them,</hi> and with them to be made <hi>Partakers of the Root and Fatneſs</hi> of the Olive Tree. And in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hereunto, it is rightly added by the Apoſtle; that <hi>the Gifts and Callings of God are without Repentance;</hi> The <hi>Inward Subſtance</hi> of the Church, and of the Covenant of Grace whereon 'tis Founded, being <hi>Invariable</hi> and that which ſhall remain for ever <hi>Immoveable.</hi> But it doth not therefore follow that there ſhould be no Alteration, in reſpect of the <hi>Outward Form, or Adminiſtration of either:</hi> For in this Reſpect, as hath been already proved, there is a wide Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between them: For barely to be of the Natural Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was ſufficient to be admitted a Member of the <hi>Jewiſh Church;</hi> but not ſo under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> unleſs we be of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And till this be Evidenced, neither therefore doth the <hi>External Badge</hi> or <hi>Cogniſance</hi> belong unto us.</p>
            <p>And thus it may appear, that this Illuſtrious Scripture is very much darkened, by applying that Holineſs and Inciſion here ſpoken of, to <hi>Outward Diſpenſations</hi> only in the <hi>viſible Church;</hi> which is meant of <hi>Saving Graces</hi> in the <hi>Inviſible</hi> by Faith. And whilſt you make <hi>every Believer a like Root to his Poſterity, as</hi> Abraham <hi>the Father of the Faithful was to his;</hi> Since no Believer in the World, whether before or ſince, had ever the like Priviledge or Prerogative conferred upon him, to be Called the <hi>Father of the Faithful,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> was.</p>
            <p>But for the further ſupport of Infants Baptiſm, It is Objected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That ſince Infants ſtood viſible Members of the Church for 2000 Years under the <hi>Legal Adminiſtration;</hi> It is unlikely they ſhould be <hi>now</hi> Excluded.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:50207:30"/>
            <p> To this we Anſwer; Firſt, That they ſtood Excluded altogether as much, above 2000 Years before Circumciſion, as they do now: So that an Ordinance for their Church-member-ſhip was not ſo <hi>from the Beginning;</hi> but came in by <hi>ſpecial Inſtitution long ſince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>other Adminiſtration</hi> in which they ſtood, was Eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with a Seed to be Propagated by <hi>Natural Generation</hi> according to expreſs Command. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9, 10. <hi>Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant therefore, thou and thy Seed after thee in their Generations.</hi> Verſe 10. <hi>This is my Covenant which ye ſhall keep—Every Man-Child among you ſhall be Circumciſed.</hi> But where have we Command for the like in <hi>this Adminiſtration?</hi> For though it ſhould be granted that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles are intended as the proper <hi>Subjects</hi> of the general <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi> mentioned Verſe 9. which yet cannot be for the Reaſons giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in the latter part of this Diſcourſe upon that Subject. Yet the Baptiſm of <hi>Infants</hi> cannot thence be juſtly Inferred: For there <hi>God</hi> only ſaith; <hi>Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant therefore, thou and tby Seed after thee in their Generations.</hi> It is true by the Seed there ſpoken of, you underſtand the <hi>Spiritual Seed</hi> in the Goſpel Day; and by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Covenant, their keeping it in the proper <hi>Sign</hi> of it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that is, <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> But where lies the Ground for <hi>Infants Baptiſm</hi> in all this? Is there a Syllable there concerning <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> that they alſo muſt be <hi>Signed?</hi> To keep the <hi>Sign</hi> of GOD's Covenant (ſay you) is to wear it <hi>themſelves,</hi> and to put it upon all theirs: The Believing Gentiles are to keep the <hi>Sign</hi> of GOD's Covenant: Therefore the Believing Gentiles are to wear it <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> and to put it upon all theirs. But who told you ſo? Or what Scripture is there that proves that <hi>thus</hi> ſtands the Caſe with the <hi>Believing Gentiles?</hi> That is, that they are not only to wear the <hi>Sign</hi> of the Covenant <hi>themſelves,</hi> but to put it upon <hi>all theirs?</hi> All that you can prove, is, that <hi>thus</hi> it was with <hi>Abraham</hi> and His, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>former</hi> Adminiſtration; and when you can alſo prove that <hi>thus</hi> it muſt be <hi>now;</hi> you ſay <hi>ſomething,</hi> otherwiſe all you ſay is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. The Covenant of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> 'tis true <hi>(Gen.</hi> 12. 2, 3. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 16, 17, 18.) is one and the ſame to <hi>them</hi> and to <hi>us;</hi> but the Covenant of Circumciſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9, was plainly <hi>Typical</hi> and <hi>Temporary;</hi> and in a <hi>Figure</hi> it Miniſtred unto the ends of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Covenant.</hi> And therefore it ſufficed as unto <hi>that</hi> Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, if the People, the Children thereof were of the <hi>Natural</hi> Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> becauſe by that <hi>ſhadowy Covenant,</hi> Young and Old, Good and Bad, were all alike Covenanters; and all alike in a Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to be the Subjects of an Adminiſtration, which was to ſerve unto the <hi>Example and Shadow of Heavenly things, till the Seed ſhould come to whome the Promiſe was made.</hi> Gal. 3. 19. But the Goſpel Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, that brings Chriſt, and all the Myſtery of His Grace,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50207:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> in the Truth and Reality, and not in the Figure and Example; is not Receptive of <hi>Children,</hi> as to the Principle upon which it ſtands, any other way than upon ſome <hi>viſible Demonſtration of Faith,</hi> whereby CHRIST comes to be received, who are therefore called <hi>the Sons of God.</hi> John 1. 12, 13. <hi>As many as Received Him, to them gave He Power;</hi> that is, the Right or Priviledge <hi>to become the Sons of GOD; Even to them that Believe in His Name: Born not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man, but of GOD.</hi> Thus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 28. Calls the Saints of the Churches of <hi>Galatia, Children of the Promiſe,</hi> in Oppoſition to the <hi>Seed according to the Fleſh.</hi> Verſe 7. <hi>Neither becauſe they are the Seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>are they all Children, but in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy Seed be called, that is, they which are the Children of the Fleſh, theſe are not the Children of GOD; but the Children of the Promiſe are counted for the Seed.</hi> Whereunto many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures might be added; yea, the whole Stream of the New Teſtament witneſſeth to a Seed' <hi>according to Calling,</hi> and (as to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>We are told indeed, that the Believing Gentiles are now <hi>Graffed in,</hi> not upon the <hi>Legal Branch,</hi> but upon the <hi>Root Olive,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth all the <hi>Nouriſhment</hi> that either the Jews had, or the Gentiles have. Which <hi>Root Olive</hi> is the Covenant of Promiſe, that was 430 Years before the Law. Now into that State of things (ſay you) wherein not the <hi>Law,</hi> but the <hi>Goſpel</hi> Preached unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> did <hi>Obtain:</hi> God was a GOD, not only to the Father, but to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; yea to all his Family. And the Father of the Family did not only give Himſelf, but all his Children, and even his Servants, all His to GOD, to take his <hi>Sign</hi> upon them, and ſo it muſt be <hi>now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which We Reply; that it is indeed the unſpeakable Bleſſedneſs of the Believing Gentiles, to be Graffed in upon ſuch a Stock; not upon the <hi>Legal Branch,</hi> but upon the <hi>Root Olive,</hi> which affordeth all the <hi>Nouriſhment,</hi> that either the Jews had or the Gentiles have; that Root Olive being no other than Chriſt Himſelf; who was given for a Covenant of the People, and <hi>a Light to Lighten the</hi> Gentiles. The Goſpel of whoſe Grace was indeed Preached to <hi>Abraham</hi> 430 Years at leaſt, before the Law was given. But what then? Doth it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow that the Believing Gentiles are put into that very State of things as under Circumciſion? Where is that Scripture that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it? Evident it is that though Circumciſion was in uſe before, as well as under the Law; and though Jeſus Chriſt Himſelf is by the Apoſtle Stiled, the Miniſter of the Circumciſion, for the Truth of God, to confirm the Promiſes made unto the Fathers; yet as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50207:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> be denied, but that it was <hi>adopted</hi> into the Legal Family: And that it was alſo <hi>adopted</hi> unto the Nature and Quality of the Legal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation: So it is as evident that it is <hi>now Aboliſhed.</hi> And we can meet with no one Text in all the New Teſtament that tells us that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is appointed to have the <hi>ſame Place</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> in the Church of God that <hi>Circumciſion</hi> had; but rather much to the contrary, as hath been already proved. And it being manifeſt that the <hi>External</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Covenant is <hi>changed,</hi> to what it was in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Time, it plainly follows that there is an <hi>Alteration</hi> of the <hi>Rule</hi> that muſt direct us in our Practice in that Reſpect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. If this Interpretation hold good, there would be a very great <hi>Change</hi> in the <hi>Extent</hi> of the Covenant; <hi>narrower</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> than it was under the <hi>Law;</hi> and yet <hi>no notice</hi> in all the Book of God given of ſuch a <hi>Change.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We Reply. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Covenant of Grace, hath one and the ſame <hi>Extent,</hi> before, under, and ſince the Law, in Reſpect of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of it, or conſidered ſingly in its ſelf, as hath been already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. In Reſpect of the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of it; indeed it is <hi>Changedble,</hi> and hath been often <hi>Changed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> we ſay, that the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> is not <hi>nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower,</hi> than that under the <hi>Law,</hi> becauſe it admits not <hi>Infants Baptiſm.</hi> The Adminiſtration under the Law was Circumſcribed to a little Land, and a ſmall People; the Bounds of the other are ſtretched <hi>from Sea to Sea, and from the River to the ends of the Earth.</hi> That was reſtrained to the Seed and Family of <hi>Abraham;</hi> the other extends to the Seed and Family of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> That had its Exiſtence but 2000 Years, upon an <hi>Occaſional, Temporary Principle;</hi> the other is ſuited to Anſwer <hi>a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple exiſting from Everlaſting to Everlaſting.</hi> That Adminiſtration was the <hi>Shadow, Figure,</hi> and <hi>Example;</hi> the other, the <hi>Subſtance.</hi> That was the <hi>Handmaid,</hi> the other the <hi>Miſtreſs.</hi> And if the Caſe be thus between theſe two Adminiſtrations, can we Reaſonably Charge the <hi>Goſpel</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration with more <hi>narrowneſs</hi> than the <hi>Law,</hi> becauſe of <hi>the Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Birth-Priviledge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Although the Grace of the Goſpel be extended far beyond the Grace under the Law; yet as to <hi>Perſons,</hi> the Children of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, are formed to ſo <hi>ſtrict,</hi> and <hi>refined</hi> a Qualification; that in <hi>that Reſpect,</hi> we grant that the <hi>Law</hi> had a Latitude beyond the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> But yet with this Mark; that the <hi>Indulgence</hi> of the Law was one of the great <hi>Imperfections,</hi> which the Goſpel came to <hi>Reform. Mat.</hi> 3. 10, 11, 12. And of this <hi>Change,</hi> the Book of God doth give abundant Notice. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 10. <hi>Caſt out the Bond-woman, and her Son,</hi> &amp;c. Shortly after the Inſtitution of the Ordinance of Circumciſion, for the Priviledge of <hi>the Seed according to the Fleſh.</hi> The Lord brings forth a Prophetical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the very Family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> wherein this great <hi>Change of</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:50207:31"/> 
               <hi>Church Priviledge,</hi> was revealed, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was to be taken from <hi>the Carnal Seed,</hi> and that it ſhould be given <hi>to the Seed according to Grace,</hi> under the Goſpel Adminiſtration. And to put that matter out of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, we have the unvailing of this Prophetical Inſtance to the very ſame purpoſe, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 30. So alſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Sing O Barren, thou that beareſt not.</hi> What ſhe was the Apoſtle tells us. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26, 27. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Thy Maker is thy Husband, the Lord of Hoſts is his Name, and thy Redeemer the Holy One of</hi> Iſrael. At <hi>ver.</hi> 13. We have the Refined Qualification of her Children and People. <hi>And all thy Children ſhall be Taught of the Lord:</hi> Where we have a Prophetical Deſcription of the <hi>Goſpel Church State,</hi> which the People of a <hi>Fleſhly Extraction</hi> only, from the moſt ſanctified Saints, cannot poſſible compare unto. It muſt therefore neceſſarily be underſtood of another Seed, even of a Seed <hi>begotten of God, by the Word of Truth.</hi> Jam. 1. 18. the Goſpel People. And this was a fair Notice given of the <hi>Change</hi> in Queſtion; to wit, <hi>narrower</hi> as to the <hi>Qualifications of the Perſons,</hi> but more <hi>extended in Grace.</hi> Another fair warning for the Fleſhly Seed; is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 15. <hi>For the Lord God ſhall ſlay thee, and call his People by another Name.</hi> In all which, we find plain notice given of the <hi>Change of the Old Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which gloried in the Seed of <hi>Abraham, after the Fleſh;</hi> and as plainly foretelling the Ceſſation of that <hi>Propagation,</hi> to give place to the <hi>New Adminiſtration,</hi> and the true Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Seed <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit.</hi> And indeed, the Change of the Adminiſtration, neceſſarily removes the fleſhly Seed, becauſe it hath a ſtanding by no other Right, than what it had under that Covenant.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> it every where abounds with Evidence to the Proof hereof, as appears from the ſeveral Scriptures that have in part been already opened and diſcuſſed, in the former part of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: Wherein it hath been proved, that though <hi>Infants</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended with their Parents in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church; yet none but ſuch as are capable of making an <hi>Actual Profeſſion of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> with ſome competent Meaſure of Fruitfulneſs, anſwerable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, are to be admitted to the Priviledge of <hi>Church-Memberſhip,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel. To this purpoſe we are told. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 7. That when many of the Phariſees and Sadduces came to be Baptized of <hi>John:</hi> Though their being of the <hi>Natural Seed of Abraham,</hi> was a ſufficient ground why they ſhould be <hi>Circumciſed;</hi> yet it was no ſufficient ground why they ſhould be <hi>Baptized:</hi> And therefore their <hi>Birth-Priviledge notwithſtanding, John</hi> rejects them as <hi>a Generation of Vipers,</hi> and bids them <hi>bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance.</hi> 'Tis true, thoſe that <hi>John</hi> had now to deal with were <hi>Men at Age,</hi> and ſuch alſo as were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly <hi>Debauched,</hi> and <hi>Vitious</hi> in their Converſations: But then it muſt be withal conſidered, that we Read of none <hi>at Age</hi> that were rejected upon any ſuch Account from <hi>Corcumciſion,</hi> which is a clear Argument
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50207:32"/> of the <hi>Change</hi> of the Adminiſtration, and that <hi>the terms of Admiſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Goſpel-Church, were far ſtricter now than they were before.</hi> And to take off their former Plea, he deals therefore plainly with them upon that Account, And tells them, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Think not to ſay within your ſelves, we have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father; for God is able of Stones to raiſe up Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto</hi> Abraham. <hi>And now alſo, the Ax is laid unto the Root of the Trees, therefore, every Tree which bringeth not forth good Fruit is hewn down;</hi> which hath been already explained to be clearly Excluſive of a meer <hi>Carnal Seed,</hi> or a Seed barely <hi>after the Fleſh,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Goſpel Church Ordinances:</hi> For upon that Account, the Ax is here ſaid to be laid unto the <hi>Root of the Trees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as plainly doth the Spirit of God by the Apoſtle, give us an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Excluſion of the Fleſhly Seed, in that reſpect; when he tells us as he doth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16, 17. <hi>Wherefore, henceforth know we no Man after the Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For if any Man be in Chriſt, he is a New Creature, Old things are paſt away, all things are become New;</hi> which hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſtinctly explained to the ſame purpoſe: Together, with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. 24. Where he tells us, that <hi>the Natural Branches are broken off,</hi> And that the Gentiles have their <hi>Standing</hi> in the Church, only <hi>by Faith.</hi> And no where doth the New-Teſtament Countenance that conceit, that our <hi>Poſterity</hi> have any Right of ſtanding as Members of the Chriſtian Church, <hi>by Vertue of our Faith:</hi> But we our ſelves muſt <hi>ſtand by our Faith,</hi> and they (if they have any) <hi>by their own:</hi> Otherwiſe, they are of courſe excluded; <hi>The Natural Branches</hi> being now <hi>broken off,</hi> and no others in their Room, barely as ſuch, according to Goſpel Rule, to be admitted to Goſpel Ordinances.</p>
            <p>But againſt this it is Objected; <q>That as the ſame Church continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the Goſpel, which did exiſt, or was in being before: So the very ſame Church Members kept their places and ſtanding in it, which were of it before; except ſuch as were <hi>broken off by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;</hi> which muſt not (ſay you) be underſtood in Reference to the <hi>Little Children</hi> of the <hi>Believing</hi> Jews, unleſs it can be made out that <hi>their Little Children</hi> were guilty alſo of the <hi>ſame Sin of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Account of which, <hi>others</hi> were thus broken off.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this we Reply. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that as it is Evident that the <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving</hi> Jews, are to this day, together with their <hi>Parents,</hi> broken off and unchurched (which can be upon no other Account, than becauſe of the <hi>Perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> both of the <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Children:</hi> For they have both of them <hi>Believing Abraham</hi> to their <hi>Father,</hi> as much <hi>now</hi> as <hi>before)</hi> So it is as Evident, that the <hi>ſame Sin of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> was as juſtly Chargeable upon the <hi>Children</hi> of thoſe of them that <hi>did believe,</hi> until wrought upon as their <hi>Parents were</hi> by the <hi>Preaching of the Word.</hi> And by Reaſon hereof it was that <hi>all ſorts of Little Children,</hi> as well as thoſe <hi>at Age,</hi> that were deſtitute of <hi>actual Faith,</hi> were now
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50207:32"/> to be broken off from the <hi>Goſpel Church.</hi> For though 'tis true, the Children of the <hi>Believing</hi> Jews, and the Children of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving</hi> Jews alſo, were upon the <hi>bare</hi> Account of their <hi>Relation to</hi> Abraham, only, by the <hi>Expreſs Command of God,</hi> under the <hi>former</hi> Adminiſtration, admitted to a State of Church Memberſhip, <hi>their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> (For whether they were <hi>Believers</hi> or no, was not at all any Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Enquiry, in Reſpect either of the <hi>Parents,</hi> or the <hi>Children,</hi> as to a State of Church-Memberſhip <hi>then)</hi> yet as hath been already proved, the Caſe is <hi>now altered:</hi> A New Law, and a New Church-State, (in Reſpect of the <hi>External</hi> Adminiſtration thereof,) was now to take place in the World: So that the <hi>terms</hi> of their <hi>former ſtanding</hi> in the Church would not <hi>ſuffice</hi> for their <hi>ſtanding now:</hi> For nothing ſhort of <hi>Actual Faith and Repentance,</hi> or an <hi>External Profeſſion thereof,</hi> could be now ſufficient; which <hi>Qualifications</hi> not being to be found in <hi>Young Infants,</hi> whether thoſe of <hi>Believers,</hi> or thoſe of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers;</hi> they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>both broken off,</hi> as well the <hi>one,</hi> as the <hi>other</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In this Reſpect therefore it ought to be duly conſidered, that the Holy Scripture doth conclude us all, <hi>by Nature,</hi> to be in a ſtate of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> and <hi>Children of wrath, as well as others;</hi> and ſuch we <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</hi> from our <hi>Infancy,</hi> 'till <hi>converted,</hi> and wrought upon by the <hi>Grace of the Goſpel.</hi> A vain thing it is therefore to pretend unto a Faith wrought in us from our <hi>Natural Birth,</hi> as the Seed of <hi>Believers:</hi> For <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi> Rom. 10. 17. As the ordinary means by which it is wrought in us. And this way of Conveyance, <hi>little Infants,</hi> as well thoſe of <hi>Believers,</hi> as thoſe of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers</hi> being uncapable of; they are therefore <hi>all of them,</hi> till then, to be reckoned as the Scripture concludes them, in a ſtate of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> Rom. 11. 32. And this being the true ſtate of the Caſe; No wonder if the <hi>Children of Believers,</hi> as well as <hi>others,</hi> were broken off from the <hi>Olive Tree,</hi> the Church, the <hi>terms</hi> of ſtanding therein being now <hi>alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> as hath been declared.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> indeed alſo tells us; that ſince the Jewiſh <hi>Infants</hi> were under the <hi>former</hi> Adminiſtration, at the <hi>Call, Election,</hi> and <hi>Appointment</hi> of God, admitted with their Parents, as <hi>Viſible Members</hi> of the Jewiſh Church: And ſince the <hi>Gifts and Callings of God are without Repentance,</hi> Rom. 11. 29. We have Reaſon therefore to conclude, that the <hi>Infants</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Parents</hi> have the ſame Right to a <hi>Viſible</hi> Church-Memberſhip <hi>now,</hi> as <hi>theirs had then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> ſhould have conſidered, that though <hi>the Gifts and Callings of God are</hi> indeed <hi>without Repentance,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Subſtance</hi> of the Covenant of Grace: Or of an <hi>Inviſible</hi> Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in the <hi>Inviſible</hi> Church; yet it doth not therefore follow, that they are without Repentance, in Reſpect of an <hi>External</hi> Memberſhip in the <hi>Viſible</hi> Church; but are and were Repealable, as by ſad Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50207:33"/> it is found to be too true, by the main Body of the Jewiſh Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Children and all,</hi> who by Reaſon of their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> are actually, and undeniably, both <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> alſo, un-Church'd, broken off, and rejected to this very day. True it is as the Apoſtle alſo tells us; <hi>if they abide not ſtill in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, they ſhall be graffed in again.</hi> And he there alſo tells us, God is both able and willing ſo to do: But then we muſt alſo remember, that as they and their Children were <hi>both</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off becauſe of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief;</hi> upon which very Account, they do both <hi>ſtill</hi> continue broken off to this very day: So therefore as a Juſt and a Neceſſary Conſequence of the former; it will alſo naturally follow, that it is only by the <hi>Actual</hi> Faith of both <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> as an Inſtrumental means, by which <hi>either of them,</hi> ſhall be bleſſed with that their deſired Reſtauration.</p>
            <p>And this may ſerve alſo for a Confutation of that Groundleſs and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural conceit of Mr. <hi>Allen;</hi> when he affirms that the <hi>Infants of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are</hi> Abraham's <hi>Spiritual Seed,</hi> and that upon this Account it was that they were admitted to the Priviledge of Church-Memberſhip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Law.</hi> For thus he tells us; <q>If ſuch Infants are as much of the Church; and as much <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Spiritual Seed,</hi> as ever Infants in the Old Teſtament-Church were; then they can be no more uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than they were of a ſolemn Admiſſion into the Church, by the Ordinance of Initiation for the time being, as Baptiſm is now, and as Circumciſion was then.</q> But this which Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> takes here for granted, and is indeed the <hi>Foundation</hi> of his Argument, we utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as not having been at all proved, nor indeed can be proved by him, or any other; to wit, <hi>That the Infants of Believers have any where in Scripture, the Denomination of</hi> Abraham's <hi>Spiritual Seed.</hi> This is a moſt certain Truth, that as <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf had a double Capacity, one of a <hi>Natural Father,</hi> the other, <hi>the Father of the Faithful:</hi> So he had a two-fold <hi>Seed.</hi> For <hi>Firſt,</hi> he had a <hi>Seed</hi> that proceeded from him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Courſe of <hi>Natural</hi> Generation only. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſome were his <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Seed</hi> alſo; ſuch as was <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and all the <hi>Faithful,</hi> who proceeded from <hi>Abrahams</hi> Loyns. To which, we muſt add a <hi>Third</hi> ſort, and that is, all true <hi>Believers,</hi> or the Elect of God in <hi>all Nations,</hi> who by Vertue of their <hi>Intereſt in Chriſt,</hi> have alſo in Scripture, the Denomination of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Seed,</hi> who yet can lay no claim to <hi>Abraham</hi> as their Father, according to <hi>the common Courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> And to imagine that <hi>Abraham</hi> hath any Seed in any other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious or Spiritual Conſideration whatſoever under the Goſpel, is to be wiſe above what is written: For (whatever the Jewiſh Children were,) to ſay that the Children of Chriſtians are Relatively Holy, that they are Church-Members, and as much Chriſtians externally, as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Jews were Jews externally, as ſome have ſuggeſted: All theſe are but unproved Figments, and Unſcriptural Dictates. And
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50207:33"/> therefore from hence to infer their Relation to <hi>Abraham</hi> as his Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Seed; and thence that they are the proper Subjects of Baptiſm, is no other than to build a lofty Structure upon a Sandy Foundation. If then we ſhall affirm that the <hi>Infants</hi> of Believers <hi>now</hi> are <hi>Abraham's Seed,</hi> they muſt of Neceſſity come under one or another of theſe Heads. To ſay that they are ſo, in either of the two <hi>former</hi> Reſpects, cannot be at all pretended unto, if in the <hi>latter;</hi> neither can this with any ſhadow of Truth be affirmed: For thus it was not with all the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Seed of <hi>Abraham himſelf,</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſly affirms. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 8. <hi>Neither</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe they are the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>are they all Children; but in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy Seed be called, that is, they that are the Children of the Fleſh; theſe are not the Children of God, but the Children of the Promiſe are counted for the Seed.</hi> So likewiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 29. <hi>If ye be Chriſts, then are ye</hi> Abraham's Seed, <hi>and Heirs according to the Promiſe.</hi> Therefore to affirm that <hi>all the Infants of Believers are the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Seed of</hi> Abraham, as there is no Scripture that <hi>proves</hi> it, ſo it is directly <hi>contrary</hi> to the Scripture; and indeed, <hi>contrary</hi> to our own moſt <hi>common</hi> and <hi>obvious</hi> Experience; whilſt we conſider with all, that as for many of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>own</hi> Natural Poſterity, they are ſo far from being his <hi>Spiritual</hi> Seed, that as hath been already obſerved, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their <hi>Children;</hi> they are Unchurched, broken off, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by God, becauſe of their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> to this very day: Which yet had not been, had they been the <hi>Spiritual,</hi> as well as the <hi>Natural Seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham:</hi> For ſure it is altogether Inconſiſtent with the terms of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>the Gifts and Callings whereof are without Repentance,</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Spiritual Seed,</hi> or that ſuch as are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Inviſible,</hi> as well as the <hi>Viſible</hi> Church, ſhould be at all caſt off, rejected and forſaken as the <hi>Jews</hi> now are.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole therefore of our Anſwer to the forementioned <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;</hi> That <hi>if this Interpretation hold good, there would be a great change in the extent of the Covenant, narrower under the Goſpel than it was under the Law; and yet no notice in all the Book of God given of ſuch a Change:</hi> We ſay that there is <hi>abundant notice</hi> given unto us, in the Book of God, and that both in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> alſo, concerning the <hi>change</hi> in queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> the disfranchiſement of Infants, from their ſo long enjoyed Priviledge of Church-Memberſhip. We grant that under the <hi>Law</hi> they were <hi>admitted</hi> thereunto with their Parents: But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures already alledged, do abundantly prove their <hi>Excluſion</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel</hi> Adminiſtration. Unto which we ſhall only at preſent add, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>For the Prieſthood heing changed, there is made of Neceſſity, a change alſo of the Law;</hi> which <hi>Change</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> there ſpoken of, muſt needs include <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> with all the Priviledges and Appurtenances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it. And therefore, as <hi>Infants Church-Memberſhip,</hi> came in with the <hi>Law of Circumciſion;</hi> ſo it went out, and was Repealed with it.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:50207:34"/>
            <p>Objection 3. If this Interpretation be true, the <hi>Believing</hi> Jews ſhould have <hi>loſs</hi> upon their Repentance and Belief of the Goſpel, if their Children <hi>formerly</hi> Church Members, ſhould <hi>now</hi> be Excluded upon the <hi>Faith</hi> and Repentance of their Parents.</p>
            <p>To this we Anſwer; <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is true that inſome Sence a Jew con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Goſpel ſhould have <hi>loſs;</hi> and particularly in that point of Signing his Fleſhly Seed, by an Ordinance; together with the Fall of all the Glory of their <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and <hi>pompous Prieſt-hood,</hi> ſo much, and ſo long, the joy and boaſting of that Nation: Which the Spirit of GOD fore-ſaw and fore-told. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 14. And hence it came to paſs that <hi>Chriſt</hi> became ſo great an <hi>Offence,</hi> and the Goſpel ſo ſore a <hi>Stone of Stumbling, and Rock of Offence</hi> to them all; yea, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to many of them, after they had ſubmitted to the Goſpel: yea, the Gentile Churches were ſcarce, if at all, preſerved from Stumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hereat, with the Jews. But all this Loſs, well conſidered, would amount to no more, than what befals a Man, who from the Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of a <hi>Servant,</hi> is Inveſted into the Priviledges of a <hi>Son.</hi> And this was the very Caſe. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>God ſent forth His Son,</hi> &amp;c. Verſe 5. <hi>To redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons.</hi> Verſe 7. <hi>Wherefore thou art no more a Servant, but a Son.</hi> And the Reaſon of this Change the Apoſtle plainly ſheweth us, Verſe 23. <hi>He that was after the Bond-Woman was Born after the Fleſh, but He of the Free-Woman was by Promiſe.</hi> There was an Infinite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the Propagation of the Seed of the <hi>former Church-ſtate,</hi> and of the Seed of the <hi>Goſpel-ſtate;</hi> no leſs than between <hi>Nature</hi> and the <hi>power of God,</hi> as was in the Types <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> Neither hath this Change brought any other <hi>loſs</hi> upon the Child: But Firſt, The Intereſt which it <hi>had</hi> in the Everlaſting Covenant under the former Adminiſtration, it <hi>ſtill retains.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Benefits and Advantages which it had by the Parent, are ſo much bettered, by how much the Spiritual State of the Parent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, by Baptiſm after Faith, is better ratified than under the Law. Thirdly, All other and further Benefits from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, are more freely and fully tendred, and with many enforcing Advantages brought near to be had and enjoyed. Fourthly, It is an Advantage, that as a Token of the Expiration of the Bondage Church State, their Signing upon the <hi>Natural Birth</hi> is alſo at an end; and their Signing into all theſe Priviledges transferred to an Ordinance upon the viſible <hi>Teſt of their New Birth:</hi> Without which no Word of GOD can be found to raiſe them to the <hi>viſible</hi> Dignity and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of the Sons and Heirs of <hi>Sarah,</hi> the Goſpel Covenant, or Adminiſtration.</p>

            <p> 
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> There is no Colour or Warrant from the Word of GOD, that Jeſus Chriſt in the Day of His Appearing, did Eſtabliſh any one Ordinance in the Church, which did Import a Communion in his <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> to be practicable duly, by a Perſon in an <hi>unregenerate</hi> State; or at leaſt, that makes not an External Profeſſion thereof.</p>

               <hi>Object.</hi> 4. But what <hi>hope</hi> can we have of our Infants, if they muſt not be admitted unto Chriſtian Baptiſm, nor reputed as Members of the Common Body and Church of the Faithful?</p>
            <p>We Anſwer: Firſt, If the Hope of the Parent for the Childs Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation be grounded upon the Adminiſtration of an Ordinance in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; then neither had the Patriarchs for above 2000 Years, Hope of their Children; which we find untrue by <hi>Noahs</hi> Prophecy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 26, 27.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We demand what Hopes are intended; and by what Scriptures the ſame are Annexed to the Adminiſtration of an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in Infancy?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We juſtifie a Holy Hope in Believers in behalf of their Children, which is grounded upon plain Scriptures without Infant Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This Argument ſeemeth to carry in it this Concluſion, That Chriſtian People by Infants Baptiſm, are by Scripture Grounds aſſured according to Goſpel Hope, of the Salvation of their Children. But there wants a Proof for it; and we ſuppoſe it is not received as a Truth by many that Oppoſe us in this Point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 5. If Children may not now be Baptized, this makes the Priviledge of Believers under the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to be leſs than was theirs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Law:</hi> For their Children were all admitted as Members of the Viſible Church by the Ordinance of Circumciſion; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but conclude, that our Priviledges for our Selves and for our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, are at leaſt as Honourable, Large, and Comfortable as theirs; and therefore our Infants are to be Baptized.</p>
            <p>To this we Anſwer, That it is true our Priviledge is the ſame with theirs, in reſpect of the <hi>Subſtance of the Covenant of Grace:</hi> But neither was <hi>that</hi> made to the Jews <hi>Natural</hi> Poſterity, as <hi>ſuch,</hi> nor is it made to <hi>ours.</hi> As for <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> It was indeed a <hi>Priviledge</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> in compariſon of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> but a <hi>Burthen</hi> in compariſon of <hi>us;</hi> And it is accordingly ſo termed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. <hi>Now therefore why tempt ye God to put a Yoke upon the Neck of the Diſciples, which neither our Fathers nor we were able to bear.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo exhorts the Believers. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50207:35"/> to <hi>ſtand faſt in their Chriſtian Liberty, and not to be Intangled again in their</hi> former <hi>Yoke of Bondage</hi> in this reſpect. And therefore it is ſo far from being a <hi>Priviledge</hi> to our Children that they ſhould have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>it,</hi> or any other thing in the place and uſe of <hi>it,</hi> that the Truth is, it is a great <hi>Priviledge</hi> that they have neither <hi>it,</hi> nor any other thing in the <hi>ſtead of it,</hi> but Chriſt manifeſted in the Fleſh. And the Parents loſe nothing by denying Baptiſm to Infants, in the place and uſe of Circumciſion; but it is indeed, if rightly conſidered, a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to them to want it, God not appointing it, nor making a Promiſe of Grace to be confirmed by it to the Infants of Believers.</p>
            <p>Clear it is, that we have <hi>no better Promiſes</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Covenant of Grace</hi> now, than they had then; only the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration</hi> of the Covenant is now <hi>better</hi> than it was to them. Then it was with Expectation of Chriſt <hi>to come;</hi> now, with Aſſurance of Chriſt <hi>already come</hi> in the Fleſh, and accompliſhing what was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of Him. Then Chriſt was ſhadowed with <hi>dark Types;</hi> now we ſee Him unvailed in a <hi>plain Hiſtory:</hi> So that though it be true that the Priviledges of Believers are now many ways Inlarged in ſome reſpects; yet ſimply the Covenant of Grace is not inlarged in reſpect of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it. The Promiſes of Grace are ſtill belonging to the Elect and Believers, and to no other.</p>
            <p>In reſpect of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9. it is plain the Jews had ſome Priviledges above us: but the want of ſome Priviledges which <hi>they had,</hi> is abundantly recompenced unto us, by other Priviledges which <hi>they had not:</hi> Particularly in reſpect of the clearneſs of the Revelation of the Goſpel Covenant; and alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the univerſal tender and publication of it; in as much as now not only the ſmall Nation of the Jews, but alſo of all Nations, Believers are brought into the participation of the ſame; together with the more abundant Communication of the Holy Spirit. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we are told that <hi>the Holy Spirit was not yet given;</hi> to wit, neither in that manner, nor meaſure, as afterward, <hi>becauſe Chriſt was not yet Glorified.</hi> Jo. 7. 39. So that it is no Abſurdity to grant that the Jews might have more Privilebges in <hi>ſome things</hi> than we; and yet our Caſe and Condition to ſpeak ſimply better than theirs, by reaſon of <hi>other Priviledges</hi> we have above them, which abundantly recompence the defect of thoſe Priviledges of theirs, whether real or ſuppoſed. And the Truth is, Priviledges are ſo Arbitrary and Various, that God gives them as He thinks good, oft times, without aſſigning any ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Reaſon. So that no Argument can be drawn, thus; GOD gave ſuch a Priviledge to the Jews; therefore we muſt have ſuch a Priviledge too, except we can prove it is GOD's Will it ſhould be ſo. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Argument is of no force without an <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> to attempt to prove, that becauſe the Jews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had a Priviledge to <hi>Circumciſe</hi> their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50207:35"/> therefore we muſt have a Priviledge to <hi>Baptize</hi> ours. Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is there any Scripture that proves that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of Infants is a Priviledge granted by GOD in lieu of <hi>Circumciſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 6. But Circumciſion was a <hi>Seal</hi> of the New Covenant to Believers and their Seed under the Law; and therefore ſo is Baptiſm to the Seed of Chriſtian Parents under the Goſpel: the denial there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Baptiſm to Infants, is the denial of a great Priviledge which of right <hi>belongs</hi> unto them.</p>
            <p>To this We Anſwer in the <hi>Negative;</hi> That neither was Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a <hi>Seal</hi> to them; nor much leſs a <hi>Seal</hi> to them of the <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> for then they had been <hi>all Saved.</hi> It is true it was a Seal, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, or Ratification of <hi>the Faith</hi> that <hi>Abraham had</hi> long before he was Circumciſed: But ſo it could not be ſaid of <hi>Infants</hi> that had <hi>no Faith.</hi> It was indeed a <hi>Sign</hi> put into the Fleſh of the Infant; but a Sign and Seal <hi>only</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Witneſſing to Him that he not only had a Juſtifying Faith, but to the Truth of the Promiſes, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>he ſhould be the Father of many Nations,</hi> Rom. 4. 17. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2. 3. <hi>The Father of the Faithful.</hi> Rom. 4. 11. <hi>Heir of the World.</hi> Rom. 4. 13. Which was no way true of <hi>any Infant</hi> that ever was Circumciſed; for none had before their Circumciſion ſuch a Faith, that entituled them to ſuch ſingular Promiſes and Prerogatives. The Scope of that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. being to ſhew that <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf was not Juſtified by <hi>Works;</hi> no not by <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> but by <hi>Faith,</hi> which he had <hi>long before he was Circumciſed,</hi> and ſo but a Seal or Confirmation of that Faith which he had <hi>before;</hi> and to aſſure him of the Truth of thoſe ſpecial Promiſes <hi>then</hi> made to him.</p>
            <p>So that though Circumciſion is rightly termed by the Apoſtle, <hi>A Seal of the Righteouſneſs of</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Faith,</hi> which <hi>he had yet being <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed;</hi> of which ſee further <hi>p.</hi> 51. 52. 53. but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from <hi>p.</hi> 205 to <hi>p.</hi> 206. Yet the Scripture no where affirms that ſo it was to <hi>any others;</hi> neither indeed could it be a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith to <hi>Infants</hi> that had <hi>no Faith;</hi> Beſides, diverſe others, who as it appears from the Scriptures, were utterly deſtitute of that Saving Grace: For ſome were Circumciſed, to whom <hi>no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> in the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> did <hi>belong.</hi> Of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> GOD had ſaid that <hi>His Covenant was not to be Eſtabliſhed with him, but with</hi> Iſaac; and yet he was Circumciſed. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 20, 21, 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 8, 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29, 30. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Eſau.</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with which it muſt be conſidered; <hi>That all that were in</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's <hi>Houſe, whether Strangers bought with Money, or Born in his Houſe, though not of his Seed, were to be Circumciſed:</hi> To whom never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, none of the Promiſes of that Covenant were made, as is plain
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50207:36"/> from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 20, 21, 23, 27. So that as far as appears to us from the Scriptures, Circumciſion was a Seal of the Rightcouſneſs of Faith only to <hi>Abraham,</hi> not ſo to the reſt; as all the <hi>Jews</hi> alſo were not called the Fathers of the Faithful, or the Fathers of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Neither is <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> more than <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> called a <hi>Seal.</hi> It is indeed called a <hi>Figure,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. And it is a <hi>Sign</hi> alſo; but a Sign and Figure proper only to <hi>Men of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding;</hi> not as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which was a Sign not Improper for <hi>Infants,</hi> becauſe it left a ſignal Impreſſion upon their Fleſh to be remembred all their Days: But ſo cannot Baptiſm be to any Infant. To affirm Baptiſm therefore to be a Seal of the Covenant of Grace is groundleſs; for that is the peculiar Work and Office of the Holy Spirit. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. and 4. 30. And ſince neither hath GOD any where <hi>Commanded</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to be Baptized, the denial therefore of Baptiſm to Infants, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the denial of any Priviledge <hi>due</hi> unto them.</p>

               <hi>Object.</hi> 7. But Circumciſion was Adminiſtred to Believers, as Believers, and to their Seed after them as ſuch; to which Baptiſm was to correſpond.</p>
            <p>We Anſwer; That Circumciſion was an Ordinance, which by the Inſtitution, belonged to all the Natural Lineage and Poſterity of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> good or bad, without any ſuch Limitation as was put upon Baptiſm; <hi>If thou Believeſt with all thine Heart thou mayſt. Acts</hi> 8. Or any ſuch Qualification that an Infant capable to receive it muſt of neceſſity have a <hi>Believing Parent:</hi> For we know that the Servants Born in <hi>Abraham's</hi> Houſe, and Strangers Bought with Money, were alſo to be Circumciſed, as well as thoſe proceeding from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Loins; who yet ſurely could not pretend <hi>to be all of them the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of Believing Parents:</hi> Which clearly ſhews, that Circumciſion was not Adminiſtred to <hi>Believers</hi> as <hi>Believers,</hi> and to their Seed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them as <hi>ſuch:</hi> But though the <hi>Natural</hi> Poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were Believers or no, were to be <hi>Circumciſed,</hi> becauſe <hi>God</hi> had ſo <hi>Commanded it;</hi> yet this was not ſufficient for their Admiſſion to <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> The main Plea indeed of the Jews in <hi>John's</hi> time was, That <hi>they had</hi> Abraham <hi>to their Father;</hi> But notwithſtanding this he rejects them, and bids them bring forth <hi>Fruits meet for Repentance,</hi> as that which alone would give them Admiſſion to the <hi>Baptiſm of Repentance.</hi> And if you ſay that this concerns the <hi>Adult</hi> only; We ſay that it concerns <hi>Infants</hi> as much; who are <hi>uncapable</hi> of that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> which the Goſpel every where requires in thoſe to be <hi>Baptized.</hi>

            <p> 
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we will know what is this Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom God doth here promiſe to be a God; according to the Letter indeed <hi>Abraham</hi> obtained the Bleſſing and Priviledges of the whole Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which came by the <hi>Law,</hi> to be the peculiar Inheritance of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>his Fleſhly Seed and Family;</hi> together, with all the ſingular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which thereby were miniſtred among them, for calling and gathering a Seed unto Chriſt in an <hi>Everlaſting Covenant;</hi> whereunto <hi>that</hi> Covenant in which they ſtood, under <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> with the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of the Inheritance thereof, did Miniſter as an <hi>Example, Figure,</hi> and <hi>Shadow.</hi> The Sum of the Covenant of Circumciſion, See <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. <hi>This is my Covenant which ye ſhall keep between me and you, and thy Seed after thee: Every Man Child among you ſhall be Circumciſed,</hi> unto <hi>ver.</hi> 15. That Circumciſion was part of the Law is plain. <hi>John</hi> 7. 23. And that it obliged all that were under it to the keeping of the whole Law, is alſo as evident, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. That the Law was a Covenant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring as an <hi>Example, Figure, and Shadow of Heavenly Things,</hi> to wit, <hi>of the Sanctuary, and of the true Tabernacle,</hi> whereof Chriſt alone was the <hi>High Prieſt and Miniſter,</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 1, 2. 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. That the Covenant of Circumciſion fell with the Law. See <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 24. <hi>Subverting your Souls, ſaying, you muſt be Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and keep the Law.</hi> As alſo, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. In this Senſe, <hi>the Bleſſing of</hi> Abraham was not to come upon the Gentiles; neither conſequently the <hi>Birth-Priviledge,</hi> which had its Inſtitution from that Covenant on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and was a principal part of the Bleſſing thereby given.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly;</hi> The Bleſſing therefore of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the Myſtery, and according to the Goſpel, is the Manifeſtation of Jeſus Chriſt, with all the Bleſſings of the Everlaſting Covenant, to be the peculiar Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Inheritance, and Right of every true Believer; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are called the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that the Type, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, having a mutual, and reſpective Application each to other, the mind of God might be clearly ſeen in them both, for the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of <hi>Shadows</hi> and <hi>Figures;</hi> which were to be <hi>done away</hi> from the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> that was not capable of any <hi>Change.</hi> Which we are manifeſtly inſtructed in by the Apoſtle. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26. <hi>Ye are all the Children of God by Faith in Chriſt; Jew, Greek,</hi> Bond, Free, Male, Female. Mark ye how the Apoſtle reſolves the point in Queſtion. at Verſe 29. <hi>And if ye be Chriſt's, then are ye Abrahams Seed, and Heirs according to the Promiſe;</hi> not if ye be the Seed of Believers, then are ye <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed; as is ſuggeſted. And this is the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> which was to come on the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> even this, that Chriſt with all his Benefits, ſhould be given to the Believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> for a Covenant.</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:50207:38"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 10. Then how can Believers be Heirs according to the Promiſe. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, 29. If their Children ſhould be Excluded from the Promiſe: For the <hi>Childrens</hi> right to the Promiſe, is a part of the <hi>Fathers</hi> Inheritance: For the Promiſe unto <hi>Abraham</hi> was; <hi>I will be a God to thee, and to thy Seed after thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We Anſwer; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That we know of none that do affirm, that the Children of Believers are <hi>Excluded from the Promiſe.</hi> But this we ſay; That as the Denial of Infants Baptiſm, imports <hi>no Excluſion</hi> from the Promiſe; ſo neither doth every <hi>Right</hi> to the Promiſe; <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate</hi> a Perſon into the Inheritance. The <hi>Jew</hi> had a <hi>Right</hi> to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, uncalled. <hi>Firſt,</hi> As God had his Remnant among them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Election. Secondly,</hi> He had a Right to the Promiſe, as God gave him a <hi>Priority,</hi> and <hi>Precedency</hi> in the tenders of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe above and before all other People. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They had a right to the Promiſe, as they were <hi>loſt Sinners,</hi> whom Chriſt <hi>came to ſeek and to ſave.</hi> But in neither of theſe Reſpects, was the <hi>Jew</hi> an <hi>Heir in the Promiſe:</hi> Such an Intereſt and Right to the Promiſe, declares the Perſon to be a Son by Adoption. And <hi>if Sons, then Heirs of God through Chriſt.</hi> Gal. 4. 7. a Priviledge which no title to the natural Father could ever prefer a Creature unto, whether under the Goſpel Adminiſtration, or before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Scripture made uſe of for Infants Baptiſm in this Objection, is this. <hi>If ye be Chriſt's, then are ye Abraham's Seed and Heirs according to the Promiſe.</hi> How plainly doth this Scripture lay the Title of the Heir upon this conditional Qualification of being <hi>Chriſt's?</hi> And he that is Chriſts, is an Heir by this Text, be the Children never ſo great Aliens and Strangers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is ſaid, that the Childrens right to the Promiſe, is part of the Fathers Inheritance: <hi>For the Promiſe is to thee, and to thy Seed;</hi> whereby is intended, that if the <hi>Father</hi> be <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, and ſo cometh to be an Heir, then the Promiſe carrieth the ſame Title of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance down to the <hi>Children;</hi> that is, if the <hi>Father</hi> be a Son of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> (which in Goſpel Conſtruction, is a Believer) then the Child muſt be a Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and a Believer alſo, even by his <hi>Birth Priviledge;</hi> directly confronting many Scriptures, which reſtrain the Bleſſing of Sonſhip to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Inheritance in all manner of Perſons, to Faith in Chriſt; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>They which are of Faith, are bleſſed with faithful Abraham.</hi> Not they which are the Children of Believers. And in the Text alledged; <hi>If ye be Chriſt's, then are ye Abraham's Seed;</hi> not if ye be the Children of Believers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As to the Interpretation of that Paſſage, taken from <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. <hi>The Promiſe is to Abraham and his Seed:</hi> Beſides what hath been
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50207:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſaid in Anſwer to the foregoing Objection: It ought to be duely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the Covenant of Grace, or the Goſpel Covenant which God made with believing <hi>Abraham,</hi> before his Removal out of his own Countrey; <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 1, 2. was not made with <hi>Believers and their Seed;</hi> but with <hi>Abraham and his Seed. In thy Seed,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 22. 18. compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2, 3. <hi>In thy Seed,</hi> that is, <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For ſo the Apoſtle tells us expreſly, <hi>That to Abraham and to his Seed, were the Promiſes made; He ſaith not unto Seeds, as of many; but as of one; and to thy Seed, which is Chriſt,</hi> Gal 3. 16. So that all Goſpel Promiſes run di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to Chriſt the Inheriting Seed. To him they are made. In him do they all center, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> him alone, all the Bleſſings in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe are to be communicated to all his Members.</p>
            <p>'Tis true in the Covenant of Circumciſion which God made with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9. which was a legal conditional Covenant: As God doth therein promiſe to be a God unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo he had alſo a Noble Seed, to whom the Bleſſings therein promiſed as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, did inure: But under this Qualification, as they were his <hi>Natural Seed,</hi> priviledged under that Typical Adminiſtration, by which this Prerogative was ſo ſetled. Now to improve this aright, the Heavenly <hi>Myſtery</hi> vailed in this Diſpenſation, muſt be ſought out: For although <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtood a common Father under the Law; yet Chriſt is the only Father, <hi>the Everlaſting Father</hi> under the Goſpel Adminiſtration. And this <hi>Anceſtour</hi> hath alſo his Seed more nobly deſcended than the <hi>Natural</hi> Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> being all the Sons of God by <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> ver. 16. Yea it is impoſſible, that by any other Qualification, men can come to be the Sons of this <hi>Anceſtour,</hi> than by being made one with him in the Participation of the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Grace of the Unchangeable Covenant. Now then it is an incompetent Application of Perſons, to compare every particular Believer and his Children, to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the common Anceſtour of a whole Adminiſtration, and the Seed priviledged thereby. And no leſs incompetent is the Application of the Qualification, requiſite in Perſons to be accounted Heirs; that becauſe it ſufficed to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Heirs, that they were the Sons of his <hi>Natural</hi> Generation, and that they were thereby made capable of an Inheritance in the <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Letter;</hi> That therefore it ſufficeth by being the Child, according to <hi>Natural</hi> Generation of any Believer, to be upon that account an <hi>Heir of God,</hi> and joint Heir with Chriſt, in the very <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Myſtery,</hi> which the former Adminiſtration did <hi>Prefigure.</hi> Upon the whole then, as to this; We ſay, that it is no right Reaſoning to infer or ſuppoſe, that the Infants of Believers, are Joynt Heirs with Chriſt and their godly Parents, under the Adminiſtration of <hi>Grace;</hi> becauſe of the Birth Priviledge given to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, by the <hi>Law.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Objection</hi> 11. Thoſe to whom the Goſpel Covenant belonged, to them the Seal thereof appertained: But to Believers and their Seed, the Goſpel Covenant belonged. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>I will be a God to thee and to thy Seed;</hi> therefore to them the Seal thereof did appertain: For the <hi>Faederati,</hi> were to be <hi>Signati;</hi> that is, thoſe that were in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, were to have the Seal thereof. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. By way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence therefore it naturally follows; that if Circumciſion, the Seal of the Goſpel Covenant, belonged to the Seed of Believers under the Law; then doth the Goſpel Seal Baptiſm, much more appertain to the Seed of Believers now.</p>
            <p>To this we Reply; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is no natural Conſequence at all from this Scripture, to infer the Baptizing of Infants; nor any ground to build the Goſpel Ordinance, Baptiſm, upon the command of the legal Ordinance, Circumciſion; as hath been already mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by what we have ſaid in our Anſwers, to ſeveral of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Objections; wherein it hath alſo been made evident, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one, nor the other are Repreſented in the Scripture, as the common Seals of the New Covenant; that being the peculiar Office of the Holy Spirit. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. We ſhall therefore in Anſwer to the preſent Objection, take occaſion, more particularly to conſider the Nature and Scope of the Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the Text alledged. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. And therein to enquire, whether the New Covenant made with Believers under the Goſpel, and that be one and the ſame? In order to the Reſolution whereof, we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that as <hi>Abraham</hi> by Promiſe ſtood in a double Capacity; <hi>viz. Firſt,</hi> As he was a natural Father unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> who proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him in a courſe of Natural Generation. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As he was a Spiritual Father; in which reſpect he was the Father of many Nations. comprehending the Spiritual <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whether Jews or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles throughout the World: So accordingly, the Promiſes made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abraham,</hi> were of two ſorts; ſome reſpecting his Natural Seed; whether Domeſtick or National, which were Typical of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; as the Birth of <hi>Ifaac;</hi> the Deliverance of his Poſterity out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> the poſſeſſing of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> with many other tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Bleſſings and Benefits, Annexed thereunto. And others again reſpecting in a peculiar manner, the Spiritual Seed, the Family of the Faithful, the Elect, of whom through Chriſt he was the Father; and which are Evangelical, belonging in an eſpecial manner to the Goſpel Covenant; As <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 5. <hi>I have made thee a Father of many Nations.</hi> And that which we find, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 5. <hi>So ſhall thy Seed be.</hi> In which it is promiſed, That there ſhould be of the Nations innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, that ſhould be <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed by believing. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 17,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50207:39" rendition="simple:additions"/> 18. And again it was an Evangelical Promiſe that we find, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 18. <hi>And in thy Seed ſhall all the Families of the Earth be Bleſſed.</hi> For in theſe is promiſed a Bleſſing to Believers, of whom <hi>Abraham</hi> is Father. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8, 9. And by Chriſt who is the Seed of <hi>Abraham. Gal.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Secondly;</hi> It is of great moment in the preſent Caſe, rightly to diſtinguiſh, and truly to apply the ſeveral Promiſes God made unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to their proper Subjects: It being evident from what hath been already ſaid, that though under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick, or National Promiſes to <hi>Abraham,</hi> peculiar to him and his Poſterity by <hi>Sarah,</hi> Spiritual Bleſſings in Chriſt were ſhadowed; yet Circumciſion was not a Token to every one Circumciſed, that the Promiſes, whether National or Spiritual, did belong to him. Nor was Intereſt in the Covenant, the Adequate, Formal, or proper Reaſon of the Circumciſing of them: For <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was Circumciſed, and others were to be Circumciſed, to whom none of the Promiſes in that Covenant were made; as is plain from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 28, 29. It is no good Argument therefore, to ſay they were in the Covenant; therefore to be Circumciſed: For Females were in the Covenant, yet not to be Circumciſed. Nor on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, Males were to be Circumciſed; therefore they were in the Covenant: For <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and others were to be Circumciſed, yet not in the Covenant. Whereby 'tis plain, that the true; Reaſon why any were Circumciſed, was the <hi>Command,</hi> not <hi>Intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> Much leſs is it true that is ſuggeſted by ſome; <hi>That Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are to be Baptized by Vertue of the Promiſe, firſt to the Parents, as Believers, and in them, to their Seed as ſubordinates:</hi> For beſides that, there is no ſuch Promiſe in Scripture, that God will be a God to every Believer, and his natural Seed: So the Rule of Baptizing, either Parents or Children, is not Intereſt in the Promiſe, by God's Promiſe to them: But their Profeſſion of Faith, or being actual Diſciples of Chriſt, whom alone Chriſt hath appointed to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to what concerns the Covenant of Grace therefore, or the Goſpel Covenant, which according to the foregoing Argument, is ſaid to be now made with Believers and their Seed, as the ground of their Admiſſion to Baptiſm: We muſt know that the Covenant of Grace is to be conſidered, either in reſpect of the Promiſes of Eternal Life, made to all the Elect in Chriſt, the which remains one and the ſame in all Ages, though variouſly Adminiſtred in the times of the Old and New Teſtament, or elſe in reſpect of the manner of its Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>For if the Covenant be underſtood in the firſt ſence of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Eternal Life and Salvation, made to the Elect in Chriſt;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50207:40"/> That did never belong to all the Children born of Believing Parents, as hath been already Inſtanced in <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> &amp;c. but only ſuch as are Elected of them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 8, 9. <hi>Neither becauſe they are the Seed of Abraham, are they all Children,</hi> &amp;c. The Covenant of Grace being firſt made between God and Chriſt, and all the Elect in Chriſt. And therefore in Scripture it is called, <hi>The Promiſe of Eternal Life, which was made to the Elect before the World began;</hi> who are therefore called, the <hi>Heirs of Promiſe.</hi> Which Promiſe, had its firſt Promulgation to <hi>Adam,</hi> in the Garden of Paradiſe; where we have alſo the firſt Diſcovery of the Myſtery of the two Seeds. Now the Covenant of Grace in this Senſe, is not the Ground and Reaſon of Adminiſtring Ordinances to any Perſon whatſoever: But the Law of Inſtitution only, is the Ground and Reaſon of viſible Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; For the Adminiſtration of Ordinances, belongs not to the ſubſtance of the Covenant; but depends meerly upon the Law of Inſtitution, without any other Conſideration. And hence we find, that from the firſt Promulgation of the Covenant to <hi>Adam,</hi> until God made the Covenant of Circumciſion with <hi>Abraham,</hi> there was no Ordinance to be adminiſtred to Infants: Though ſome Infants as well as grown Perſons, both of Believers and Unbelievers, might be comprehended in the Covenant: Yet not to be Circumciſed; and ſo not to be Baptized, for want of an Inſtitution. So the Promiſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. is ſaid to be to them afar off, in the preſent tenſe, while uncalled: And yet not to be Baptized before calling, unleſs you will Baptize Gentiles in profeſſed Gentiliſm. And ſo the Jews; ſome not yet born, ſome not called, have the Promiſe of God made to them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>For this is my Covenant unto them, when I ſhall take away their Sins.</hi> And yet they are not to be Baptized 'til Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. Nor indeed can the Covenant, conſidered in its pute Nature, be a Miniſters Rule to Adminiſter Ordinances by, ſeeing it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known who are in the Covenant, and who are not: But that which is their Rule muſt be ſomething that is manifeſt.</p>
            <p>As for the External Adminiſtration of the Covenant, as you have already heard, that hath varied in ſeveral Ages, according to the Will of the Law-giver: for during all that period of time, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> there was no Ordinance to be Adminiſtred to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. In <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time indeed, Circumciſion was Inſtituted, which Ordinance belongs peculiarly to the <hi>Old Teſtament Adminiſtration,</hi> and was part of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, which is now Abrogated and done away. And this was the firſt Ordinance that was Adminiſtred to Infants; and not to all Infants, but only to Male Infants, Living in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, if they did Live to the <hi>Eighth</hi> Day; otherwiſe they had no right to this Ordinance, though many of them doubtleſs in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and ſo Saved. So we ſay of Infants in the Days of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50207:40"/> the Goſpel; many of them are in the Covenant of Grace, and ſo Saved by Virtue of the Free Promiſe: But yet not to be Baptized, if they do not Live to the <hi>time</hi> of Believing and Repenting, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly time appointed for Baptiſm: So that the Adminiſtration of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to Infants depends upon the Law of Inſtitution only, and not upon their being in Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly;</hi> In this reſpect therefore it ought to be duly conſidered, as hath been before Obſerved; That the Covenant of Grace, or the Goſpel Covenant, which Believers are now under (whereof Chriſt is the alone and only Mediator) was not made with <hi>Believers and their Seed,</hi> but <hi>with Abraham and his Seed;</hi> that is <hi>Chriſt:</hi> For ſo the Apoſtle tells us expreſly; That <hi>to Abraham and his Seed were the Promiſes made; He ſaith not unto Seeds as many, but as of one: And to thy Seed which is Chriſt.</hi> So that all Goſpel Promiſes run to Chriſt, the Inheriting Seed; To Him they are made; In Him do they all center; and from Him alone are all the Bleſſings in Promiſe to be derived unto all His Members.</p>
            <p>'Tis true; In the Covenant of Circumciſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 7, 8, 9. (which was a Legal Bondage Covenant, and therefore now repealed, as ſhall be afterward ſhewn) God doth indeed therein promiſe to be a GOD to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Fleſhly Seed; and to give them the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for an Inheritance. And their Obedience to Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is expreſly called the Covenant on their Part. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. <hi>This is my Covenant which ye ſhall keep between Me and you, and thy Seed after thee; Every Man-Child among you ſhall be Circumciſed.</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 8. <hi>And he gave them the Covenant of Circumciſion; and ſo</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>begat</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and Circumciſed him the Eighth Day.</hi> By which they ſtood engaged to keep all thoſe other Additional Ordinances which <hi>Moſes</hi> gave them, when they were about to enter their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Inheritance. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5, 3. <hi>For I teſtifie that whoſoever is Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, he is a Debtor to do the whole Law.</hi> But the Covenant of Grace which God ſhade with Believing <hi>Abraham</hi> before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of his own Countrey (and therefore long before the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Circumciſion was in being) runs in another ſtrain. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as GOD <hi>freely</hi> Promiſeth to Bleſs <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf; ſo he doth as <hi>freely</hi> Promiſe to <hi>make him a Bleſſing:</hi> For that <hi>in him,</hi> that is, <hi>in his Seed,</hi> Chriſt, <hi>ſhould all the Families of the Earth be Bleſſed.</hi> Gen. 12. 2, 3. And this was a Covenant of Grace <hi>indeed;</hi> a Covenant that was <hi>purely Evangelical;</hi> every way <hi>Extenſive</hi> and <hi>Abſolute,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unchangeable: For therein God hath <hi>freely</hi> Promiſed a Bleſſing unto <hi>all ſorts</hi> of true Believers, whether Jews or Gentiles; in giving unto them an <hi>Eternal Inheritance.</hi> Heb. 9. 15. <hi>Incorruptible and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, that fadeth not away, Purchaſed by the Blood of Jeſus, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Heaven for them;</hi> of which the <hi>Earthly Inheritance</hi> in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50207:41"/> Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was a <hi>Type.</hi> So that as there was a two-fold Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> a Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> and a Covenant of <hi>Works:</hi> So there is a two-fold <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> a <hi>Fleſhly</hi> and a <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> Typed out by <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac;</hi> and a two-fold <hi>Inheritance,</hi> an <hi>Earthly</hi> and a <hi>Heavenly:</hi> But the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Inheritance was not given to the <hi>Fleſhly</hi> Seed, but only in <hi>Types</hi> offered to them; and confirmed only to the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Seed, whether Jews or Gentiles; who in that reſpect are called the <hi>Heirs of Promiſe;</hi> yet not immediately, or at firſt hand rate, but through the <hi>Mediation</hi> of Chriſt alone, <hi>in whom all the Families of the Earth are Bleſſed.</hi> For as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the Child of the Fleſh had no right with <hi>Iſaac<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in the outward <hi>Typical</hi> Promiſe; ſo <hi>Iſaac</hi> himſelf by vertue of his <hi>fleſhly</hi> deſcent, had no right nor intereſt in the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Inheritance. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7. any otherwiſe, than as he came to have an <hi>Intereſt in Chriſt.</hi> And therefore we find the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle expounding the Word of Promiſe; ſheweth that the Evangelical Promiſes made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> were not made to any one Fleſhly Seed; no not with the meer Fleſhly Seed of Believing <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf; but theſe Promiſes did all run to Chriſt the Inheriting Seed, to whom they were made; and when Chriſt was come they all centre in Him. <hi>Now to Abraham and his Seed</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>were the Promiſes made. He ſaith not unto Seeds as of many, but as of One; and to thy Seed, which is Chriſt.</hi> In whom all the Promiſes of the Goſpel, <hi>are Tea and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly:</hi> Having thus followed the Promiſes down from <hi>Abraham</hi> unto CHRIST; let us now ſee to whom they come forth again, and it is not to any ones <hi>Fleſhly</hi> Seed whatſoever; but from Chriſt they all Flow forth again to <hi>Believers,</hi> and only to <hi>Believers;</hi> and that by vertue of their <hi>union</hi> with Chriſt. To this purpoſe the Apoſtle tells uſ; That <hi>if we be CHRIST's, then are we Abraham's Seed, and Heirs according to the Promiſe;</hi> There being no way to partake of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but by <hi>Faith in Chriſt.</hi> Gal. 3. 22. <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all under Sin, that the Promiſe by Faith of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>might be given to them that Believe.</hi> So that all the Promiſes run to Chriſt, and from Him Flow forth again only to Believers; not to them and their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Off-ſpring,</hi> as is Suggeſted, further than they are <hi>Believers</hi> alſo in their <hi>own Perſons:</hi> For no otherwiſe was it with the <hi>Fleſhly Seed</hi> of Believing <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf. Which being Impartially Conſider'd, is a full Anſwer to all Arguments drawn from the Covenant, and the the Promiſes made to <hi>Abraham;</hi> and certainly, and unavoidably cuts off <hi>Infants Church-member ſhip</hi> in the Days of the Goſpel (unleſs you can find a new Inſtitution for it;) and conſequently it leaves no room for <hi>Infants Baptiſm;</hi> unleſs it can be proved that all the Infants of Believers, are <hi>Heirs of Abraham's Faith,</hi> Believing as he did: and that the Promiſes are theirs, not by <hi>Application</hi> or <hi>Analogy,</hi> but <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:50207:41"/> and <hi>properly;</hi> and by their own <hi>Perſonal</hi> Faith: Which the Scriptures do no where Affirm.</p>
            <p>And indeed ſo to Aſſert, would be not only contradictory to the Scriptures; which tell us <hi>that we are all Children of Wrath by Nature:</hi> But to all former and latter <hi>Experience.</hi> Then would Grace be a <hi>Birth Priviledge;</hi> and <hi>Regeneration</hi> tied to a <hi>Natural Generation.</hi> Then muſt all the Poſterity of <hi>Believers</hi> be <hi>Saved;</hi> unleſs that Doctrine be true, that <hi>Men may fall from Grace.</hi> Then muſt we tie up and reſtrain the Grace of God's Covenant to the Children of <hi>Believers</hi> only; and then what Hope for the Poſterity of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers?</hi> Contrary to the Experience of all Ages; whilſt Grace was extended to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were not the Off-ſpring of <hi>Believers;</hi> when the <hi>Natural</hi> Branches the Children of <hi>Believing Abraham</hi> were cut off.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly.</hi> Whereas you tell us; That all thoſe that were <hi>Faederati,</hi> were to be <hi>Signati;</hi> that is, all thoſe that were in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> were to have the <hi>Seal</hi> thereof. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. And that therefore it natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows, that if <hi>Circumciſion</hi> the Seal of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Seed of Believers under the <hi>Law;</hi> Then doth <hi>Baptiſm</hi> much more appertain to the Seed of Believers under the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> We Reply, by denying the Conſequence of the Argument: For though it ſhould be granted that the Covenant of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9. is indeed a <hi>Goſpel Covenant;</hi> and that all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Believers are therein <hi>comprehended</hi> with their Parents; Yet it follows not that they are therefore to have the <hi>Seal</hi> thereof. For the <hi>conſequence</hi> muſt be proved from this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal;</hi> All that are in Covenant muſt be Sealed: Which is not true. If it were true, it muſt be ſo either by Reaſon of ſome neceſſary Connexion between the Terms, which is none: For it is but a common Accident to a Man that hath a Promiſe or a Covenant made to him, that he ſhould have a ſpecial <hi>Sign</hi> for the confirmation thereof; It may be preſent or abſent from the Subject. God made a <hi>Special Promiſe</hi> to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> that he ſhould bring <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> To <hi>Phineas a Covenant of an Everlaſting Prieſt-hood.</hi> without any <hi>ſpecial Sign or Seal</hi> diſtinct from the <hi>Covenant.</hi> Or elſe it muſt be ſo by reaſon of <hi>GOD's Will</hi> declared concerning the <hi>Covenant of Grace:</hi> But that is not true. The <hi>Promiſe</hi> made to <hi>Adam,</hi> which was the ſame in ſubſtance with the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> had no ſpecial <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Seal</hi> annexed to it. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> were within the Covenant of Grace; yet no ſpecial Sign appointed them. Therefore it is not God's Will that <hi>all</hi> that are in the Covenant muſt be Sealed; If they had, it had been <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll Worſhip,</hi> God not appointing it to them. And if you ſay, All that are in Covenant <hi>ſince Abraham's time,</hi> ſhould be <hi>Sealed:</hi> But neither is that certain; ſince we find no ſuch thing concerning <hi>Melch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſidek</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> that Lived in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time; nor concerning <hi>Job,</hi> that its conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50207:42"/> lived after his time. You will ſay, but it is true of thoſe that were in Covenant in <hi>Abraham's Family:</hi> But neither is that true: For Male Children <hi>before the eighth day,</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> though in Covenant, yet were not to be Sealed. So that you ſee it is ſo far from being univerſally true, that all that are in Covenant muſt be <hi>Sealed,</hi> that this is all which is true. <hi>All the Male Children of</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Family, if they were eight days old, muſt be ſigned with the Sign of Circumciſion;</hi> which will never be able to prove the <hi>Conſequence</hi> of the Argument; That therefore <hi>All</hi> the Children of Believers, Males, or Females muſt be <hi>Baptized,</hi> unleſs there were an <hi>Expreſs Command,</hi> or <hi>Example</hi> in the New Teſtament, ſignifying God's mind unto us therein.</p>
            <p>The Covenant of Grace was Ratified and Confirmed unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> a conſiderable time before the Covenant of Circumciſion was given to him, <hi>viz.</hi> about twenty five years before it; and had then no outward Sign or Seal annexed thereunto. And indeed that which hath been of late affirmed; <hi>That the Covenant of Grace always had an Outward Sign or Seal added to it.</hi> is ſo wide a Miſtake, that on the contrary it may be affirmed; That although the Efficacy of its Grace, did reach Believers in all Ages; yet it was not filled up with Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Worſhip proper and peculiar to it ſelf, until the times of Reformation; nor had till then any outward Sign or Token, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately belonging thereunto: For had it been ſo, this Sign or Token, as the Covenant it ſelf, had remained without change, and not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed away with the other Shadows of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Oeconomy. Mr. <hi>Cox</hi> in his Diſcourſe of the Covenants, <hi>p.</hi> 83, 84.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid; That though the ſign of Circumciſion was <hi>Actually applyed</hi> only to the <hi>Males;</hi> yet it muſt be underſtood, that the <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males</hi> were <hi>virtually</hi> Circumciſed <hi>in them,</hi> as the Nobler Sex. We anſwer, That the Concluſion to be proved, is, that Infants are to be Sealed <hi>Actually;</hi> not <hi>Virtually:</hi> For if a <hi>Virtual</hi> Sealing, or Baptizing, were all that you would prove we might grant it, we may ſay, Infants are virtually baptized in their Parents, and yet it may be unlawful to Baptize them <hi>Actually,</hi> as it would have been unlawful to have Circumciſed Women <hi>Actually,</hi> (had they been capable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) notwithſtanding their <hi>Virtual</hi> Circumciſion: For it had been a <hi>Will-Worſhip,</hi> there being no <hi>Command</hi> to do it. And indeed to ſpeak exactly; Women were not Circumciſed <hi>Virtually</hi> in the Males: For he is ſaid <hi>Virtually</hi> to have a thing by another, as by a <hi>Proxy</hi> or Attorney, that might receive it by <hi>himſelf;</hi> yet according to the Effect of Law, <hi>another</hi>'s receiving it, is as if <hi>he</hi> had received it: But ſo the <hi>Males</hi> did not receive Circumciſion for the <hi>Females;</hi> For the Females had they been capable, might not be Circumciſed in their <hi>own Perſons:</hi> It had been their Sin if they had received it, God not appointing it; as it had been a Sin for a Child to be Circumciſed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50207:42"/> before or after the eighth day, in them that altered or ſwerved from the Appointment of God. So that the Concluſion remains yet to be proved, that all the Infants of Believing Parents are to be <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> Signed, or Sealed by the Ordinance of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> unto which you give the term of the <hi>Goſpel Seal.</hi> For as there is no <hi>Command</hi> for the ſame in the New Teſtament; nor any <hi>Example</hi> that may give hint unto us, of the mind of God therein: So neither can it be proved by any juſt <hi>Analogy</hi> or <hi>Proportion,</hi> between <hi>that</hi> and <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with which it muſt be conſidered, that there are other ſigns of the Covenant, beſides <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> As <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and the Paſs-over of old, ſo the Lord's Supper now. If then we ſhould grant the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion in general, that the Infants of Believers are to be <hi>Signed;</hi> yet you would ſay, they are not to be Partakers of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not appointed for them: So in like manner, it follows not that they are to be Baptized, unleſs you can prove that it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to them. And indeed there is as much reaſon for the <hi>one,</hi> as for the <hi>other:</hi> For if we muſt <hi>Examine our ſelves</hi> before we be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>one;</hi> wbich you ſay Infants <hi>cannot do:</hi> So <hi>Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> are required as the Condition of the <hi>other.</hi> which Infants are as <hi>uncapable of;</hi> and therefore cannot be duely admitted to <hi>either,</hi> without ſome Expreſs, ſignifying God's Mind unto us therein. For though it may be good to argue thus; <hi>It is God's Mind, therefore it is to be done;</hi> yet it is too much for us to argue, <hi>This ſhould be, and therefore God hath appointed it;</hi> Inaſmuch, as no <hi>Reaſon</hi> of <hi>ours,</hi> in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive</hi> Worſhip, ſuch as <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is, but <hi>God's Will</hi> alone, gathered by ſome <hi>Expreſs Command,</hi> or <hi>Example</hi> in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> can acquit an Action ſo performed from the Guilt of <hi>Will-Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Whereas you conceive that <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm</hi> are appointed by God, as common <hi>Seals</hi> of the New Covenant; this is affirmed without Proof: For no where doth the Scripture give that Character to them; that being the peculiar Work or Office of the Holy Spirit, as hath been already proved. 'Tis true, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in his own Perſon, is by the Apoſtle <hi>Rom</hi> 4. 11. Termed, <hi>A Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which he had yet being <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, that he might be the Father of all them that believe.</hi> But ſo it cannot be ſaid of Infants that had no Faith; much leſs could any of them pretend to that Prerogative that <hi>Abraham</hi> had. Indeed, from hence to conclude that Circumciſion was appointed by God, as a <hi>Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> or of the Covenant of Grace, to the Generality that were the Subjects thereof, is groundleſs: For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iſaac,</hi> nor <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor any beſides, had before or after their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, ſuch a Faith, which Entituled them to ſuch ſingular Promiſes. It cannot be juſtly affirmed of <hi>Iſaac, Jacob, David,</hi> or any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Patriarchs; That <hi>they received the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:50207:43"/> 
               <hi>the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which they had, yet being <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed, that they might be the Fathers of all them that believe,</hi> as it is of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> This being a peculiar Honour, that is by the Spirit of God conferred on <hi>Abraham</hi> alone, and is indeed Incommunicable to any elſe, how famous ſoever for Faith and Holineſs; much leſs can it be affirmed of the Generality of the Jewiſh Infants, that were the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Subjects of Circumciſion. We deny not, that the Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others than <hi>Abraham,</hi> was a <hi>Token</hi> (as the Spirit of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf expreſly terms it) of the Covenant then made with <hi>Abraham:</hi> But it doth not therefore follow, that every ones Circumciſion was to him a <hi>Seal of his Right, to any of the Promiſes thereof;</hi> as is evident in the Caſe of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and many others, the Servants born and bred in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, and Strangers bought with Money, who were all to be Circumciſed; to whom, nevertheleſs none of the Promiſes in that Covenant were made; as is plain from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 20, 21, 23, 27. Much leſs was Circumciſion a Seal to all that received it, of their Intereſt in the Righteouſneſs of that Faith that <hi>Abraham</hi> had; for then they had been all ſaved. It was therefore intended only as the <hi>Reſtipulation</hi> of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed after him, on <hi>their Part;</hi> or as a Sign or Token of their <hi>Duty to God;</hi> not as a Seal of <hi>God's Promiſe to them.</hi> Gen. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that Circumciſion was ſo far from being <hi>a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> or of the Goſpel Covenant, to the Generality that were under it, that it was rather a <hi>Token of Servitude and Bondage;</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Yoke,</hi> that as the Apoſtles tell the <hi>Jews; Neither they, nor their Fathers were able to bear it.</hi> Acts 15. 10. Gal. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Which yet it had not been, had it been to them, as well as to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, a <hi>Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith:</hi> For that brings with it true Chriſtian Liberty and Freedom.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Notwithſtanding the Promiſes made in the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, (faith Mr. <hi>Cox</hi> in his Diſcourſe of the Covenants, <hi>p.</hi> 152, 153, 154.) and the Separation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to be the peculiar People of God, in purſuance of them; yet that Covenant did not confine
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50207:43"/> the ſolemn Worſhip of God (by Sacrifices or otherwiſe) to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Family: Nor were other Holy Men then living under any Obligation, to Incorporate themſelves thereinto by Circumciſion; or at all to take upon them that Sign, or token of that Covenant that God then made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> which yet without doubt they ſhould have done, if it had been a <hi>Seal of the Covenant of Grace:</hi> For then by reaſon of their Intereſt in that Covenant, both in point of Duty and Priviledge, it had equally belonged unto them, as to the Seed and Family of <hi>Abraham.</hi> But from the ſacred Hiſtory, it is evident, that the command, by vertue of which Circumciſion was Adminiſtred, extended no further than to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Family. And therefore we have no ground to conclude, that <hi>Lot</hi> (though nearly Allied to <hi>Abraham)</hi> was Circumciſed. Seeing there is nothing in the Command of God, or firſt Inſtitution of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion that obliged him thereunto, or intereſted him therein, and yet there is no doubt to be made of his Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace. Neither was <hi>Lot</hi> the only Righteous Man then living in the World, beſides thoſe of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family: For of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, <hi>Heber, Salah,</hi> and <hi>Shem,</hi> were then living; and as they had their diſtinct Families and Intereſts, ſo there is no queſtion, but the pure Worſhip of God was maintained in them, and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted the Intereſt of true Religion to the utmoſt of their Power, while they lived. Yea <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was in being about this time, (whether he were <hi>Shem</hi> before named, or another, it concerns not us to determine; but this is certain, that it was he) who <hi>was the Prieſt of the moſt High God, and King of Salem;</hi> and in both theſe Reſpects, the moſt Eminent Type of Jeſus Chriſt that ever was in the World; a Perſon greater than <hi>Abraham:</hi> For <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham paid Tythes to him, and was bleſſed by him.</hi> Now conſidering that he was both King and Prieſt, there is no doubt but there was a Society of Men that were ruled by him, and for whom he Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred: For a Prieſt is ordained for Men in things pertaining to God. And this Society was at this time, as much a Church of God, as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family was, and as truly intereſted in the Covenant of Grace, as any therein; yet were they not concerned as Parties in the Covenant of Circumciſion, nor to be ſigned thereby: From whence it is manifeſt, that Circumciſion was not applied as a Seal of the Covenant of Grace; nor did an Intereſt therein render a man the proper ſubject of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again; <q>It is no ways difficult (ſaith he) to conceive, that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion might have a different Reſpect, according to the differing Circumſtances and Capacity of its Subject.—It was to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which he had,</hi> &amp;c. But this aroſe from the peculiar and extraordinary Circumſtances and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50207:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> Capacity that he was in: For it is not poſſible to conceive, that Circumciſion ſhould be a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which he had while Uncircumciſed, that he might be the Father of all them that believe in Uncircumciſion, to one that never had Faith, either before or after his Circumciſion, nor ever had, or ſhould have the Relation of a Father to all Believers, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had. In which reſpect, it is equally abſurd to ſay, that Circumciſion was a Seal unto all its Subjects, of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which they had while Uncircumciſed, as to affirm, that it was the Seal of a Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Relation to all Believers, unto every one that received it: And therefore both theſe muſt neceſſarily be reſolved into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Circumſtances of <hi>Abraham;</hi> the particular Relation he had in the Covenants made with him, and not into the Nature of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, conſidered ſimply, and in it ſelf. What Circumciſion was directly, and in its immediate uſe, is one thing; and what it was as ſubordinate to a better Covenant and Promiſe, that had Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency to it, is another. And it is eaſie to conceive, that it was that to the Father of the Faithful, in its extraordinary Inſtitution, that it could not be to the Children of the Fleſh, or carnal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ed, in its ordinary Uſe.</q> 
               <hi>Page</hi> 189, 190, 191. 194.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole therefore, it clearly appears, That Circumciſion was never appointed by God, as a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, or of the Goſpel Covenant, to the Generality of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects thereof. It was indeed a Token of the Covenant then made betwixt God and them; but a Seal only to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that in reſpect of <hi>the Righteouſneſs of the Faith, which he had, being yet <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, that he might be the Father of all them that believe;</hi> which cannot be affirmed of any others. And ſo for Baptiſm; it is indeed called a <hi>Figure,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 21. But a Sign or Figure proper only for men of Underſtanding; not as Circumciſion, which was a Sign not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for Infants, becauſe it left a ſignal Impreſſion upon their Fleſh, when they came to underſtand the Reaſon of it: But ſo cannot Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm be to any Infant. And indeed if Baptiſm be as you ſay it is, a Seal of being already ingrafted into Chriſt, and conſequently into the Church; then it is a Seal only to Believers, who alone are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereof: Since it is by Faith that men are in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20, 29. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17, And therefore it cannot be any Seal at all to Infants that have no Faith; But as it is evident, that a Profeſſion of Faith is required of all to be Baptized. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Act</hi> 8. 37. which Infants are uncapable of; ſo it is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that though Baptiſm is indeed a Sign or Figure of Regeneration to the Baptized. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. yet a Seal it cannot be, that being the Work which the Holy Scripture aſſigns unto the Holy Spirit only. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>In whom alſo after ye believed, ye were Sealed by that Holy</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:50207:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>Spirit of Promiſe.</hi> And no where is it aſſigned unto Baptiſm, Beſides, as the true Seal of the Goſpel Covenant is not at all at Man's diſpoſe. <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 8. as Baptiſm is, if that be it; So it is as certain, that God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſets his Seal to a Blank: Which yet it muſt of Neceſſity follow, that he doth, if Circumciſion or Baptiſm either, were appointed by God as Seals of the Goſpel Covenant; or as Seals of their Intereſt, in the Righteouſneſs of Faith, to whom ſoever they were to be Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, both ſerve to repreſent Spiritual Things and Myſteries, and therefore may be juſtly enough termed Signs, Tokens, or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures: But yet in a different Reſpect, as well as alſo in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: For though Circumciſion might and did ſignify the Duty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or the Neceſſity thereof to Infants, when they came to Years of Underſtanding: Yet Regeneration in Actual being before their Circumciſion, could not be ſignified by it (for then they had been all ſaved) as it ought to be in the Baptized, at leaſt, in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. Which is all the Baptizer is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, which cannot be expected of Infants: However, by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Operation of God; the great Work of Regeneration may be wrought in them, from which they are not excluded by us, though they are from Baptiſm for want of an Inſtitution. And if you ſay you have as much Reaſon to look upon Infants of Believers to be San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, as we have to eſteem grown Chriſtians to be ſuch; becauſe our owning of theſe as ſuch, depends upon their own Teſtimony only, in a Verbal Profeſſion, which may be Counterfeit. We Anſwer, That this is not Cogent; foraſmuch, as we have no Teſtimony of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants that they are Regenerate; but Viſible Profeſſion of grown Per, ſons, being Free and Serious, is not only in the Judgment of Charity, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> alſo of Miniſterial Prudence, to be taken for a Sign of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though it may be in God's Sight Counterfeit, which belongs to us to examine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly.</hi> But then at laſt you tell us; That though it cannot be made out, that God hath promiſed to be a God by Regenerating and Juſtifying every Believer's Child; which cannot be affirmed of all the Natural Poſterity of Believing <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 8. Yet, ſay you, they are <hi>in Covenant in Reſpect of outward Priviledges.</hi> But this we alſo deny: Nor do the Scriptures any where give any Countenance at all unto ſuch a conceit. No Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the whole <hi>New Teſtament</hi> doth affirm it; neither by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; nor any other way, as a Nation; or by ſolemn Oath; or by having Prophets ſent unto them; or by any other Revelation of Gods Mind or Promiſe; are Infants ſaid to be now at all in Covenant with God, upon this Account? And if it could be made out that they have an External being in the Covenant; yet that gives them no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50207:45" rendition="simple:additions"/> in the Covenant of Grace, by God's Promiſe to be a God to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s Seed. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. And therefore that Text is in vain alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to prove Infants to have an Intereſt in the Covenant of Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Bleſſings, and ſo of right to be Sealed with the Seal thereof. For your Argument, if the terms be diſtinctly opened, is nothing elſe but this. <hi>Infants of Believers, as their Natural Seed, are all in the Goſpel Covenant; not in the Inward; but the Outward; that is, in the Outward Adminiſtration; that is, Baptiſm; and therefore to be Baptized.</hi> Which is meer trifling; as proving that they are to be Baptized, becauſe they are to be Baptized; and is but a meer <hi>Petitio Principij</hi> or a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful begging the Queſtion in diſpute.</p>
            <p>It hath been frequently demanded by us, what plain Scripture can you produce for the Warrant of Infants Baptiſm? But for want of a plain Scripture Proof, you are driven to make Uſe of Conſequental Deductions. And among the reſt, you ſeem to have your Principal Reliance upon thoſe drawn from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. deriving your Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence concerning <hi>Infants Baptiſm,</hi> from the Covenant of Evangelical Bleſſings, which you ſay was there made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed after him: And from the Intereſt, which as you ſay, the Children of Believers have, together with themſelves in that Covenant; you thence Argue, they are to be Baptized: Becauſe all that are in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ought to have the Seal thereof. When the invalidity of this Plea is made manifeſt; you then fly to a <hi>Covenant of outward Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,</hi> which you ſay the Children of Believers are concerned in with themſelves: But then we would willingly know, what Scripture is it that makes mention of this Covenant of outward Priviledges? <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. makes not mention of it: For that you have often told us is to be underſtood of the Covenant of Grace; containing purely, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Everlaſting Bleſſings; and therefore cannot be underſtood of outward Priviledges; or concerning the bare Adminiſtration or Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of an outward Ordinance, which is the thing driven at. Where then ſhall we find this Covenant of outward Priviledges mentioned, or Recorded?</p>
            <p>Beſides, both Circumciſion and Baptiſm alſo, according to your former Reckoning, are but Seals of the Covenant, and not the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant it ſelf. <hi>All that are in Covenant</hi> (ſay you) <hi>muſt have the Seal thereof;</hi> that is, <hi>ought to be Baptized:</hi> Whereas, after this Rate, the Seals and the Covenant it ſelf are ſtrangely confounded together. <hi>The Children of Believers</hi> (ſay you) <hi>are in Covenant, equally with themſelves; not in the Inward, but in the Outward part of it, in reſpect of External Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, that is, Baptiſm.</hi> But then, what becomes of the Seal, ſo much contended about? Unleſs, we muſt take it for granted, that the Seals of the Covenant, and the Covenant it ſelf, are the ſame thing, and no Diſtinction at all to be made between them. So that upon
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50207:45"/> the whole, it clearly appears that your Arguments from the Covenant, however ſet forth or managed by you, are no other than a <hi>darkning of Counſel, by Words without Knowledge.</hi> And therefore, while you do Labour to faſten ſuch Diſmal Conſequences on our Doctrine, who deny the Children of Believers to be taken into Covenant with themſelves, in the ſenſe expounded: We ſay they are unduly charged on us, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch, as we do not exclude the Infants of Believers from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of Salvation. For though we ſay not that they are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by their Parents Faith: And though we deny that they have any Right to Church Priviledges, till they are capable of making an Actual Profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, according to the Goſpel Rule; yet we ſay, they may be by Gods Election ſaved; and may be ſanctified by the Spirit of God; and Parents may have ground of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in their Death, as much or more than according to your Doctrine, which tells them, that their Children are in the Covenant only, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of outward Priviledges; the Enjoyment of which, nevertheleſs, can give us no undoubted Aſſurance of their Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly.</hi> And Laſtly (as to this) whereas you tell us that Chriſtian Baptiſm is come in the Room, Place, and Uſe of Jewiſh Circumciſion; So as that the Inſtitution of that ſhould be our Rule about Baptiſm. To anſwer this doubt, let us conſider the great difference between Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and Baptiſm. Circumciſion was a Legal Ordinance, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Jewiſh Males, Reprobate, as well as Elect, by a poſitive Command, to diſtinguiſh them from the reſt of the World, as a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Covenant, God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſignified, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come of his Loins, according to the Fleſh. But Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is an Evangelical Ordinance, whereby Jew or Gentile, Male or Female; upon a Profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, is Baptized in Water, in token of Regeneration; and to ſignifie the Death, Burial, and Reſurrection of Chriſt, the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> already come; and ſo added to the Viſible Church, and admitted to all the Priviledges thereof.</p>
            <p>The Conſideration of the great difference in their Inſtitution, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrates this alſo: For when Chriſt inſtituted Baptiſm, he ſays; <hi>Go Teach, and Baptize;</hi> and in the Adminiſtration, <hi>they confeſſed and were Baptized;</hi> not a Word of <hi>Infants.</hi> And in the Precept of Circumciſion, not a Word of <hi>Teaching,</hi> or <hi>Faith,</hi> but of <hi>Infants,</hi> the command ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly notes the <hi>Time, Age,</hi> and <hi>Sex.</hi> And therefore, ſince things become Ordinances to us, by Vertue of a Word of Inſtitution, and no ſuch Word is to be found, to make out that Baptiſm ſucceeds Circumciſion, in its Room, Place, and Uſe: We think it ſafe to be ſober, and advance no further than the Scripture guides. And indeed, to make Circumciſion Inſtitutive of Baptiſm, is no other than to ſend us to School to the Law, and that <hi>Firſt, Old, Vaniſhing Covenant,</hi> as it is ſtiled. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 13. as if the Lawgiver in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> had
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50207:46"/> not by a poſitive Inſtitution eſtabliſh'd his Ordinances; nor left us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny warrant for our Goſpel Duties, without that Retrogreſſion to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and aſſimulating them to the Paedagoggy, and ſimilitude of Types.</p>
            <p>Beſides, when you tell us that Chriſtian Baptiſm is come in the <hi>Room, Place,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of Jewiſh Circumciſion; ſo as that the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that ſhould be our Rule about Baptiſm. This is not right: For Firſt, then Infant Females ſhould not be Baptized, as hath been already noted. And to ſay that Females were Virtually, and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively Circumciſed, in the Circumciſion of the Males, is frivolous: For if ſo, by Analogy, the Females ſhould be only Virtually, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatively, and not Actually Baptized. And if Infants out of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Family were not Circumciſed, though the Parent believed in God, as a Proſelyte of the Gate. <hi>e. g. Cornelius:</hi> Then neither ſhould an Infant of a Believer in Chriſt, not in a National, or other Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted <hi>Church,</hi> be Baptized. And if Circumciſion were of the Uſe of Baptiſm, the Circumciſed Infant needed not to be Baptized. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> it appears from <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17. That a Principal Uſe of Circumciſion, was to ſignifie <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come of <hi>Abraham;</hi> which Baptiſm not doing hath not a Principal Uſe of Circumciſion. <hi>Thirdly.</hi> though Baptiſm diſtinguiſh between Believer and Unbeliever; yet it doth not make a Partition Wall between Nation and Nation, as Circumciſion did; which was not to be imparted to all Believing Males of the Gentiles, as is manifeſt in the Caſe of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who though fearing God, was not Circumciſed, nor to be Circumciſed; unleſs, joyned as a Member of the Jewiſh People. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Circumciſion bound Men to keep the whole Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or elſe was Unprofitable. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 25. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. But Baptiſm Witneſſeth, that the whole Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> is now made void, and only Chriſt's Law is to be kept. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Circumciſion was Adminiſtred to <hi>Abraham's Natural Seed,</hi> without any Profeſſion of <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> or <hi>Regeneration;</hi> whereas, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is only to be Adminiſtred to <hi>the Spiritual Seed of</hi> Abraham; upon an Actual Profeſſion of <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Regeneration.</hi> Mark 16. 16. Acts 8. 36, 37.</p>
            <p>It is granted, that in ſome things there is an Analogy betwixt them; both ſignifying Heart Circumciſion, and an Initiating into the Church: though as the Church it ſelf is a different Church from that under the Law; ſo it hath different Subjects and Church Members, and thoſe to be Admitted upon different Grounds, and to different Ends, and in a different manner: The one to be done in a private Houſe, and by a private Hand; the other in ſome publick Place, by the hand of ſome publick Miniſter, appointed by the Church to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtet the ſame. But it follows not that becauſe there is ſome Analogy between Baptiſm and Circumciſion, therefore one cometh in the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50207:46"/> room, ſtead, and uſe of the other: For by the ſame reaſon we may as well conclude that Baptiſm cometh in the room and ſtead of the Ark, Manna, Rock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And from ſuch like Arguments drawn from Analogy, what Jewiſh Rites may not be Introduced to the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Roman Church, in their High Prieſt-hood, and all other their innumerable Rites and Ceremonies, which without any Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chriſt, or New Teſtament Authority, they have Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon the account of Analogy with Old Teſtament Rites and Ceremonies. And therefore if we will follow this way of Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Infant Circumciſion to Infant Baptiſm, we muſt fall back not only to Popiſh but Jewiſh Ceremonies alſo. Nor is that Plea ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to avoid it, to ſay we bring not in a new Rite in Baptizing Infants, if we uſe it not as Chriſt appointed. So they might ſay of Bell Baptiſm; and the Phariſees of their waſhing of Hands, Cups, and Veſſels of Braſs; yet condemned by Chriſt, becauſe not Commanded, but after Mens Traditions taught. Papiſts ſay they bring not in a New Rite in their Maſs; yet we charge them with a great Sin in making it a Propitiatory Sacrifice, and the Prieſt a Sacrificing Prieſt, as the Jews. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> did not bring in a new Rite; yet when they uſed it otherwiſe than Chriſt appointed, <hi>it was not to Eat the Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper.</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 20. It being the Apoſtles Rule, to uſe it <hi>as it was received by him of the Lord.</hi> And they that admitted Infants to the Lord's Supper, or ſhall do it, may ſay as much as you for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Baptiſm; that they do only apply an Inſtituted Ordinance, by way of Proportion to ſuch Subjects, though they are not Expreſly called to a Participation thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 12. But it is yet further Objected; That though 'tis true, when God made a Promiſe to <hi>Abraham, to be a GOD to him, and to his Seed.</hi> The Seed there mentioned, is applyed to Chriſt. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>He ſaith not unto Seeds, as of many, but as of one; And to thy Seed, which is Chriſt.</hi> Yet this is not to be underſtood of Chriſt <hi>Perſonal,</hi> but of Chriſt <hi>Myſtical;</hi> as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. And ſo is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Viſible Church, of which Infants Born of Believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are a part.</p>
            <p>To this we Reply; That we muſt not be put off with bare Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; but we expect Solid Proof from Scripture as to the point in hand; it being evident that the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. refers not to <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. but to <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2. 3. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 17, 18. as ſhall be afterward made manifeſt. And whereas you ſay, that the Promiſes are to be conſidered, as made to Chriſt Myſtical; that is, to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church; the contrary appears. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. where the Apoſtle affirms, <hi>that Chriſt was the Seed to whom the Promiſes were made.</hi> And
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50207:47"/> in Verſe 19, He ſaith, <hi>the Law was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſions, 'till the Seed ſhould come to whom the Promiſe was made.</hi> Where it is Obſervable, that the Law, that is the Moſaical Adminiſtration, is ſaid to be before the Seed was come, and was to have its Period then. Now if by the Seed Chriſt be not to be underſtood Perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but Myſtically, for the Viſible or Inviſible Church (take which you will) then the Law could not have been before the Seed: For God had His Church in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family 400 Years, at leaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law was, of which Chriſt was the Head, and they His My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body. And ſo by this Interpretation the Seed ſhould have been before the Law; contrary to the Apoſtle, who makes the Law to have been before the Seed, and to have its Period, when the Seed to whom the Promiſe was made, was come. And now the Promiſes running to Chriſt Perſonal, GOD makes Him over for a Covenant to the Elect, and all the Promiſes in Him. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 6. So that in Chriſt he is Our GOD; and in Chriſt He takes us to be his People. In Chriſt, and a right to the Promiſes; Out of Chriſt and <hi>Strangers to the Covenants of Promiſe.</hi> Eph. 2. 12. So that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Promiſes were firſt made to Chriſt <hi>Perſonal,</hi> and in Him to His <hi>Myſtical Body</hi> the Church, who are united to Him by <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> As to that Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>For as the Body is One, and hath many Members, and all the Members of that One Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many, are one Body: So alſo is Chriſt.</hi> It rather ſeems alſo to be meant of the <hi>Inviſible</hi> Church of true Believers, than of the <hi>viſible:</hi> For the Apoſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there calls none <hi>the Body of Chriſt,</hi> but ſuch as had <hi>received the Gifts of the Spirit.</hi> And ſuch as <hi>by one Spirit,</hi> as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring Cauſe, <hi>had been Baptized into one Body;</hi> yea, ſuch who had received the Spirit <hi>to profit withal;</hi> ſuch that had a real <hi>Sympathy</hi> one with another. Verſe 26. <hi>If one Member ſuffers, all the Members ſuffer with it. If one Member be Honoured, all the Members rejoyce with it.</hi> All which cannot in any tollerable Senſe be applyed to the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, amongſt whom there are many Hypocrites that never <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit;</hi> nor by the Spirit could <hi>ſympathize</hi> one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But however it be, moſt certain it is that <hi>Infants</hi> are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Body of Chriſt,</hi> if it be meant of the <hi>viſible</hi> Church. Indeed by Virtue of the Grace of <hi>Election,</hi> ſome of them may be Members of the <hi>Myſtical</hi> Body, the <hi>Inviſible</hi> Church; but not at all Members of the <hi>Viſible:</hi> Eſpecially from this Chapter; where it is ſaid <hi>that if one Member ſuffer, all the Members ſuffer with it, and the Manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every one to profit withal:</hi> which cannot be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to Infants: For none in this Chapter are counted the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> but ſuch as are uſeful to the Body, as an <hi>Eye,</hi> an <hi>Ear,</hi> a <hi>Hand,</hi> a <hi>Head,</hi> &amp;c. as v. 21. <hi>The Eye cannot ſay to the Hand, I have no need</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:50207:47"/> 
               <hi>of thee; nor the Head to the Foot, I have no need of you.</hi> From whence we draw theſe two Concluſions. Firſt every Member in a Church ſtands in need of the help of all the other Members. Secondly, That every Member in a Church muſt be <hi>uſeful</hi> in his place to the reſt of the Members. But of what <hi>uſe are Infants</hi> to the reſt of the Members, in reſpect of <hi>Edification?</hi> So that notwithſtanding this Objection, It is plain that all the Promiſes reſpecting Spiritual Bleſſings and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Inheritance, were firſt made to Chriſt <hi>Perſonal;</hi> and in Him they are made over to his <hi>Myſtical</hi> Body the Church, who are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>to Him by Faith.</hi> And in this reſpect therefore, it ſtill lies upon you to prove that God hath made the <hi>Natural Birth Priviledge,</hi> a way under the <hi>Goſpel</hi> Adminiſtration to be <hi>Ingraffed into Chriſt Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> So that upon the whole as to this, you may ſee to how little purpoſe the Promiſe in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. is alleadged to Prove the thing in Queſtion, to wit, the Baptiſm of Infants now under the Goſpel. That Text ſpeaks of a Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>his Seed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> It doth not ſay with <hi>all Believers</hi> and <hi>their Seed,</hi> or all <hi>Church. Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> and <hi>their Seed.</hi> Neither doth it follow by any neceſſary <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> that becauſe GOD made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>his Seed,</hi> therefore He hath made a Covenant with Believers and <hi>their Seed.</hi> Certain it is, the Apoſtle was of another Mind, who when he Expounds the Covenant of Grace, underſtands it to be made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> not as a <hi>Natural</hi> Father, but <hi>as the Father of the Faithful,</hi> both Jews, and Gentiles. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. 12. <hi>He received the Sign of Circumciſion that he might be the Father of all them that Believe,</hi> and walk in his Steps. So <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Know ye therefore that they which are of Faith, the ſame are the Children of Abraham.</hi> And thoſe only are the Seed to whom the Goſpel Covenant was made, and not to the <hi>Natural Seed</hi> either of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or any other Believers. Which hath been already made appear, and that beyond any juſt Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 13. But then it is yet again Objected. That in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. The Apoſtles are there commanded <hi>to Teach</hi> or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple <hi>all Nations, Baptizing them;</hi> But Infants are Diſciples, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be Baptized.</p>
            <p>To this we Anſwer; That by that very <hi>Commiſſion. Mat.</hi> 28. The Lord hath plainly given a Caution for the leaving out of <hi>Infants</hi> in this Adminiſtration, according to ordinary <hi>Rule:</hi> For in that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them to Baptize <hi>Diſciples,</hi> upon <hi>Preaching</hi> he doth exclude <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi> who are not ſuch <hi>Diſciples;</hi> nor according to ordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can be. Infants after an ordinary rate, are <hi>uncapable</hi> of <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> the Goſpel when Preached; and therefore are <hi>uncapable</hi> of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50207:48" rendition="simple:additions"/> being made Diſciples thereby: And there is no other way according to an ordinary Rule, of being at all made <hi>Diſciples</hi> but by <hi>that means.</hi> And this the Apoſtles could eaſily underſtand, as knowing that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the term <hi>Diſciple,</hi> in common Speech, and in the whole <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> thoſe only are meant, who being taught, Profeſſed the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine Preached by ſuch a one: As <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples; <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; the Diſciples of the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> and the Diſciples of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters. Acts</hi> 20. 30. And accordingly they Adminiſtred Baptiſm. And in that Chriſt appoints <hi>theſe</hi> to be Baptized he Excludes <hi>others:</hi> For the <hi>appointment</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is moſt certainly the <hi>Rule</hi> according to which we are to Adminiſter <hi>Holy things;</hi> and they that do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe follow their own Inventions, and are guilty of <hi>Will Worſhip.</hi> If you ſay that Infants are Diſciples <hi>Seminally,</hi> in and by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; as if Believers could beget Believers or Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by <hi>natural</hi> Generation; this hath been already at large diſproved: The Chriſtian Church being not made up of Perſons by meer <hi>humane</hi> Birth, but <hi>Spiritual Regeneration.</hi> And to ſay that Infants are Born Diſciples by a Relation to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and ſo may have the <hi>Seal</hi> ſet on rhem, without any precedent <hi>Teaching,</hi> is but an unproved Dictate; as if a Title to Baptiſm were by a <hi>Relation to the Covenant,</hi> and Baptiſm were in its Nature a Seal of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which the Scripture no where Affirms; nor is there any Rule for the Baptizing of Perſons becauſe of <hi>Relation to the Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is further Urged to this purpoſe; that <hi>Infants</hi> are called <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> by the Apoſtle. Acts 15. 10. <hi>Now therefore why tempt ye God to put a Yoke upon the Neck of the Diſciples?</hi> Which being ſpoken of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi> muſt needs (ſay you) refer to <hi>Infants,</hi> as the <hi>Diſciples</hi> there ſpoken of, as well as <hi>others.</hi> To this we Anſwer, That there is no neceſſity nor colour of giving to <hi>Infants</hi> the Name of <hi>Diſciples</hi> from that Text: For though it is true that they are called <hi>Diſciples,</hi> upon whoſe <hi>Necks</hi> the falſe Brethren would have put <hi>the Yoke of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion;</hi> yet this proves not <hi>Infants</hi> to be certainly meant by <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi> ſince <hi>adult Believers</hi> of the Gentiles alſo were required by the <hi>Jews</hi> to be <hi>Circumciſed,</hi> as <hi>Timothy. Acts</hi> 13. 20. And again, though it is true that they would have had Infants, as well as the converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be Circumciſed; yet the <hi>putting the Yoke of Circumciſion,</hi> is not <hi>Actual</hi> Circumciſion, in <hi>their Fleſh:</hi> For that the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>able to bear</hi> for many Ages, and that both before, and ſince alſo to this day: But the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Circumciſion is the <hi>Neceſſity of it</hi> on Men's <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,</hi> and therewith the <hi>whole Law of</hi> Moſes. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and that as Neceſſary to <hi>Salvation. ver.</hi> 1. And therefore <hi>Peter</hi> having ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Why tempt ye God to put a Yoke upon the Necks of the Diſciples.</hi> Adds <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>But we believe, that through the Grace of the Lord Jeſus, we ſhall be ſaved even as they.</hi> Plainly implying that the <hi>Yoke</hi> he meant,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50207:48"/> was the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of Circumciſion, and keeping <hi>Moſes his Law to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Now <hi>this Yoke</hi> was not put upon <hi>Infants,</hi> but upon <hi>Brethren, taught the neceſſity of it.</hi> So that upon the whole, to inſiſt upon a Command by <hi>virtual Conſequence</hi> from hence for the Baptizing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Believers according to ordinary Rule, is ſo far from being <hi>right</hi> and <hi>genuine,</hi> that on the contrary this Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves Infants are <hi>not</hi> by ordinary Rule to be <hi>Baptized;</hi> becauſe <hi>Diſciples of all Nations,</hi> and no other are Appointed thereunto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whence it follows that <hi>the Baptiſm of Infants</hi> is beſide the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> and <hi>Rule of Chriſt;</hi> and therefore no other than <hi>Will Worſhip</hi> and a <hi>Humane Invention.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> The Queſtion between us is; Whether the Infants of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, <hi>univerſally</hi> or <hi>indifferently,</hi> are to be admitted to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptiſm, according to ordinary Rule? Now it cannot be ſuppoſed that the Infants of Believers, <hi>indifferently</hi> or <hi>vniverſally,</hi> have <hi>actually</hi> the thing ſignified by <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> that is, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt, Adoption, Forgiveneſs of Sins, Regeneration,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life:</hi> For then they are all Sanctified, and all Believers. And if this could be proved, there would be no Queſtion about <hi>Padobaptiſm.</hi> Thoſe Texts, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 47. <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 17. would unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably prove it. And there is no <hi>Antipaedobaptiſt</hi> but will grant, that all thoſe concerning whom there is any <hi>tollerable Evidence</hi> given that they are <hi>Regenerated Perſons, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited to Chriſt,</hi> whoſe <hi>Sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,</hi> and that have <hi>received the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> are to be Baptized. Now to affirm that <hi>all</hi> Infants of Believers, either <hi>Actually</hi> or <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively,</hi> are Sanctified, Regenerated, Juſtified, is quite contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo to daily Experience.

But doth not our Saviour tell us, <hi>that unto ſuch belongeth the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> If Children therefore are capable of the <hi>greater,</hi> then they are capable of the <hi>leſſer.</hi> If capable of a Memberſhip in the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> then of the <hi>Sign</hi> and <hi>Cogniſance</hi> thereof: But the Firſt is true; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Latter.</p>
            <p>To this We Anſwer, Firſt, That that which you are to prove is, that <hi>all</hi> the Infants of Believers, or the Infants of Believers, in as much as they are the Infants of Believers, are <hi>Actually</hi> partakers of the <hi>Inward Grace</hi> of Baptiſm, and conſequently ſuch to whom apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Heavenly Kingdom. Now neither doth the Apoſtle's Speech, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. prove it; as hath been already ſhewed: Nor doth this Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 14. prove it. And as neither of theſe prove it; So <hi>Rom:</hi> 9, 6, 7, 8, 9. Poſitively diſproves it. For firſt it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whether thoſe were <hi>Infants</hi> or no, of whom Chriſt here ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: There being ſeveral Learned Men, as <hi>Piſcator</hi> and others, that do maintain that the Speech of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 14. is not of <hi>Infants;</hi> but of Children that were <hi>capable of Inſtruction:</hi> Which they gather from this <hi>that Chriſt called them Luke</hi> 18. 16. And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where He ſaith, <hi>Whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little Ones that Believe in Me. Mat.</hi> 18. 6. <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 42. Which after an ordinary rate of Speech cannot be intended of <hi>Infants.</hi> And whereas it is ſaid in <hi>Mark. He took them up in His Arms.</hi> The Word ſo Tranſlated; is uſed <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 36. for the Imbracing of thoſe that were of ſome <hi>growth,</hi> whom He placed in the midſt, and of whoſe Scandalizing He there warns. Nor doth the Greek Word, uſed <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 15. Tranſlated in Engliſh <hi>Infants,</hi> prove it: For the Greek Word there Tranſlated <hi>Infants,</hi> as <hi>Piſcator</hi> himſelf tells us, ſignifies a Child <hi>capable of Teaching.</hi> As when it is ſaid <hi>Timothy knew the Sacred Scriptures from a Child:</hi> that is, ever ſince he was a <hi>Boy,</hi> not an <hi>infant:</hi> It being the ſame Greek Word that is uſed in both places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi> Though it ſhould be granted that thoſe were <hi>Infants;</hi> yet there is no Certainty, only Conjecture, that they were Believers <hi>Infants;</hi> which yet ought to be proved if you ſay any thing from hence to the purpoſe. For though Chriſt was then in the Coaſts of <hi>Judea,</hi> yet it might as well be, that the Children were brought by <hi>others,</hi> as Parents, and that without <hi>Faith in Chriſt, as the Meſſiah,</hi> upon the Fame of his <hi>Miracles</hi> and the conceit that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Let it be granted they were the <hi>Infants of Believers,</hi> of whom our Saviour here ſpeaketh, <hi>that of ſuch is the Kingdom of God.</hi> It may be (as <hi>Piſcator</hi> alſo obſerves) referred not to their <hi>preſent</hi>

            <p>Fourthly. Though it ſhould be granted that the little Children Chriſt here ſpeaketh of, are indeed <hi>young Sucking Infants,</hi> that they are alſo the Infants of Believers: and that unto them alſo <hi>belongeth the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> yet this is no ſufficient Ground or Warrant for us therefore to Adminiſter <hi>Baptiſm to Infants;</hi> It being only the <hi>ground</hi> laid down in the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> that can juſtly <hi>warrant</hi> the ſame. That a <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of Faith and Repentance is a <hi>ſufficient ground</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably to be proved from the Scriptures: But becauſe <hi>ſome</hi> of our Infants are, or may be in a ſtate of Salvation: or becauſe, for ought as we know, unto <hi>all of them belongeth the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> that therefore they muſt all be <hi>Baptized,</hi> whether capable of making an Anſwerable Profeſſion or no: Neither doth the preſent <hi>Scripture</hi> prove it, which ſpeaks nothing at all of <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> nor doth any other that we can meet with, give any <hi>Warrant,</hi> or Countenance at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a <hi>Practice.</hi>

               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:50207:50"/> both Children, Servants, Slaves, and all, whether making a <hi>Profeſſion of Faith and Repentance</hi> or no.) And this may appear by taking a view of the ſeveral Examples of Baptizing, recorded in the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, it is ſaid <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>There went out to him all</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and all</hi> Judea, <hi>and all the Region about</hi> Jordan, <hi>and were Baptized of him in</hi> Jordan, <hi>Confeſſing their Sins.</hi> In which the practice of <hi>Baptizing</hi> was not by taking in a <hi>Family,</hi> but by admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>all</hi> that would become <hi>Diſciples,</hi> over all the Countries. After the Aſcention of Chriſt, the firſt Example of Baptizing is that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 44. And there it is ſaid, <hi>they that gladly received the Word were Baptized.</hi> And thoſe were they of whom he had ſaid, V. 39. <hi>The Promiſe is to you and to your Children. And there were added un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them about</hi> 3000 <hi>Souls.</hi> But no mention of any <hi>Infants:</hi> neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is there any <hi>probability</hi> that any <hi>Infants</hi> were at all Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that Number; in as much as 'tis afterwards told us, Ver. 42. That <hi>they continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine and Fellowſhip, and in Breaking of Bread, and in Prayers.</hi> Which cannot with any ſhadow of pretence be applied to <hi>Sucking Infants.</hi> The next Example is that of the Samaritans; of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 12. That <hi>when they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And Ver. 44. we are told; <hi>While Peter yet ſpake theſe Words, the Holy Ghoſt fell on all them which heard the Word, and they ſpake with Tongues, and magnified God;</hi> which cannot be affirmed of Infants. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there being convincing Evidence that they that had thus heard the Word, had received the Holy Ghoſt; <hi>he commanded them to be Baptized in the Name of the Lord.</hi> Concetning the Houſhold of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus;</hi> which is ſaid to be Baptized, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 16. they are ſaid to have <hi>addicted themſelves to the Miniſtry of the Saints.</hi> To which moſt aptly may be adjoyned the Houſe of <hi>Criſpus;</hi> concerning whom it is ſaid. <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 8. <hi>And Criſpus the chief Ruler of the Synagogue, Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Lord with all his Houſe; And many of the Corinthians hearing, Believed and were Baptized.</hi> Where under the term <hi>Houſhold</hi> thoſe only are meant that Believed. And thoſe that among the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were <hi>Baptized,</hi> are ſaid firſt to <hi>hear and Believe.</hi> The next men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is the Houſhold of <hi>Lydia,</hi> of whom it was ſaid that <hi>She was Baptized and her Houſhold.</hi> Acts 16. 15. But this muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by other places, which when they expreſs the Baptizing of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50207:50"/> 
               <hi>Houſhold,</hi> they expreſs alſo the <hi>Believing</hi> or <hi>Receiving of the Word by the whole Houſhold;</hi> and by the frequent uſe of the Word, which is to put the Houſe for the People of <hi>Growth</hi> in it. The laſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is the Houſhold of the <hi>Jaylor, Acts</hi> 16. 33, 34. of whom it is ſaid <hi>that he was Baptized, he and all his; and when he had brought them into his Houſe, he ſate Meat before them, and Rejoyced, Believing in God with all his Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole then it doth not appear that either one <hi>Infant</hi> was Baptized, or that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> always took place as the <hi>Old Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> did, by bringing in whole <hi>Families</hi> together; yea the contrary appears, out of the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. As alſo from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 13, 16. That the <hi>Husband</hi> was Converted ſometimes without the <hi>Wife;</hi> and the <hi>Wife</hi> ſometimes without the Husband. So ſometimes in the Houſe of <hi>Infidel Maſters,</hi> were <hi>Converted Servants.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 1, 2. And on the contrary, <hi>Phil.</hi> 11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And our Lord Jeſus fore-told it ſhould be ſo in the Preaching of the Goſpel. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 35. 36. To affirm there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that there were <hi>Infants</hi> in any of thoſe forementioned <hi>Houſholds,</hi> or if there were that they were <hi>Baptized,</hi> is more than doth well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us to aſſert, ſince the Scripture makes no mention of them in either reſpect: And conſequently much to blame are they that build their Practice upon ſo infirm a Bottom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 17. But then it is again <hi>Objected;</hi> That as there is no Expreſs Command or Example in the Scripture concerning the Baptiſm of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; ſo neither is there any concerning the Baptiſm of Perſons at Age, whoſe Parents were Chriſtians, and who have been Educated from their Child-hood in the Chriſtian Religion; the Scripture giving no account of the Baptiſm of any in the Apoſtles Days, but ſuch as were Converted from Judaiſm or Paganiſm to Chriſtianity. And if a juſt Conſequence may be admitted for the proof of the one, Why not for the other alſo? You are wont to reject all Scripture Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences in reſpect of Infants Baptiſm; and yet here you muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity admit of the ſame: So that this Argument therefore returns upon your ſelves.</p>
            <p>To this we Reply; Firſt that though it ſhould be granted that there is no expreſs Example in the Scripture of the Baptiſm of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at Age, whoſe Parents were Chriſtians, yet the Precept concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Baptiſm is as expreſs for ſuch, as for any others. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Go Teach all Nations; Baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. <hi>Go Preach the Goſpel to every Creature. He that Believeth and is Baptized ſhall be Saved.</hi> Where none are excluded that are capable of being Taught or Diſcipled into the true Faith or Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, let their Parentage be what it will.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is ſufficient unto us, that as the Commiſſion is expreſs, ſo there are Examples enough in the Scripture concerning the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50207:51"/> of <hi>Believers.</hi> So that let a Perſon be but a <hi>Believer,</hi> and we have no Reaſon to look into his <hi>Pedigree;</hi> nor have we any Rule that ſo directs us, in order to his Admiſſion to Baptiſm. And as we have no Rule nor Reaſon to accept of a Perſon that believes, the rather becauſe he had Chriſtian Parents; ſo neither to reject him upon that ground. Could the like Command or Examples be produced from the Scripture concerning <hi>Infants Baptiſm,</hi> as can eaſily be produced concerning the <hi>Baptiſm of Believers</hi> (for under that Notion only are we bound to take Cogniſance of thoſe Baptized by us) the preſent Controverſie would ſuddenly be concluded betwixt us. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This cuts not off our Pretenſions, to ſomething more than a bare conſequential Deduction for the Juſtification of our Practice; whilſt Conſequences only, and thoſe far fetch'd, and ſtreined enough, are the beſt bottom that Infants Baptiſm is built upon: Which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of yours, are a moſt inſufficient ground for the Juſtification thereof: For though it is true, that in reſpect of all ſorts of moral Duties, or other concernments of Chriſtianity, Conſequences are allowable enough, and we are ſufficiently warranted in our Practice therein, and that not only from the Practice of our Saviour himſelf, who took this Method for the Proof of the Reſurrection; but from ſeveral other ſuch like Inſtances in the Scripture. And indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, neither can the Word be Preached, not the Duties of Chriſtianity inforced, as they ought upon the Conſcience; yet this is an infallible Maxim, a Rule beyond all juſt Contradiction, and which hath accordingly been urged by multitudes of Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, by way of Oppoſition to the Papal Uſurpation; <hi>That in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of all Poſitive or Inſtituted Worſhip, ſuch as Baptiſm is, that hath no other Rule nor Reaſon, than the meer Will of the Law-giver; there muſt be ſomething in the Scripture, either by way of Precept or Example, that alone can juſtly warrant our Practice therein.</hi> The Reaſon is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, becauſe Baptiſm (being a part of Inſtituted Worſhip, not found in Natures Garden) hath of it ſelf no vertue, but what it receives from the <hi>Inſtitutor:</hi> It being a right Note, That <hi>Moral Laws are good, and therefore commanded: But Poſitive Worſhip is commanded, and therefore good.</hi> And accordingly, though Moral Duties are eaſily deducible from their proper Premiſes; yet we cannot poſſibly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive unto any certain Knowledge of our Duty in reference to Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Worſhip, without ſome expreſs ſignification of God's mind unto us therein. True it is, that in ſome Caſes, if an expreſs Precept be wanting, we may juſtly enough recurr to the Example of the Apoſtles, as a ſufficient Authority for our Practice. As for Inſtance, in the Caſe of the Obſervation of the Lord's day; concerning which though we have no expreſs Precept to warrant our Practice therein,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50207:51"/> we are yet juſtifiable enough upon that Account, in that we have the frequent Examples of the Apoſtles, recorded in the Scripture to that purpoſe; whoſe ſteps we are bid to follow. But when Precept and Preſident do both fail us, as is moſt evidently the caſe with us in reſpect of Infants Baptiſm, and which hath been accordingly ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly owned, by ſome of the chiefeſt of the Paedobaptiſts themſelves: We do certainly ſtep aſide into a wrong Path, in our Practices of that kind. And juſtly enough therefore, may our common Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries the Papiſts, twit us in the Teeth with the Guilt of a Self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Practice, while we blame that in them, which yet we our ſelves do allow in other Caſes. And how can we call upon them, to produce ſomething o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> other by way of Precept or Preſident from the Scripture, for the juſtification of their Ceremonies, without the one or the other of which, we juſtly condemn them as unlawful, when we our ſelves are found highly guilty of the ſame Tranſgreſſion, and that in a greater degree in other Reſpects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 18. But it is yet further Objected; That Infants by God's expreſs Command, were to be Circumciſed under the former Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration; and all God's Commands about His Inſtitutions then, (according to the Rules of Analogy or Proportion) are equally bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto us, as well as to the <hi>Jews.</hi> As in the caſe of the Chriſtian Sabbath, unto which the Fourth Commandment binds us, as it did the <hi>Jews</hi> to the former. And thus it is in reference to Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; in reſpect of which, though there is no expreſs Command to that purpoſe, recorded in the New Teſtament; yet we cannot but conclude, that God's Command unto the <hi>Jews</hi> to Circumciſe their Infants, carries with it the force, at leaſt, of a virtual Command un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us to Baptize ours.</p>
            <p>To this we reply; That certain it is, that that which concerns the Worſhip of God, which hath not an expreſs Inſtitution in the New Teſtament, is now to be rejected by us; which is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as we have ſaid before, in reſpect of Poſitive Worſhip, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in outward Rites; ſuch as Circumciſion, Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper are, which have nothing Natural or Moral in them; but are meerly Ceremonial. For as for that which is Natural, or Moral in God's Worſhip, we allow that an Inſtitution or Command in the Old Teſtament, is Obligatory to Chriſtians under the New. And ſuch do we conceive the Sabbath to be, as being of the Law of Nature: For outward Worſhip being due to God, Days are due to God to that end; and therefore even in Paradiſe appointed from the Creation; and in all Nations, in all Ages obſerved, enough to prove ſo much to be of the Law of Nature. And therefore the Fourth
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50207:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> Commandment is juſtly put among the Morals; which proves, that at leaſt a ſeventh Portion of time is to be dedicated more immediately to the Service of God. Now Circumciſion hath nothing Moral in it; it is meerly Poſitive. Neither was it ſo from the beginning; nor obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by all Nations, in all Ages; nor is it in the Decalogue. And therefore the Obſervation of the Lord's Day may ſtand, though Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion fall, and though there be no other Ordinance come in the room of it, that bears Analogy or Proportion with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When we require expreſs Inſtitution in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in reſpect of the Matters of God's Worſhip now to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by us; We do not mean, that in all Poſitive Worſhip, there muſt always be of neceſſity a poſitive Command in ſo many Words, in form of a Precept: But we conceive, that the Example of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, which hath not a meer temporary Reaſon, is enough to prove that Inſtitution from God, to which that Practice doth relate. And in this therefore as we ſaid before, in Anſwer to the foregoing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; we reckon it a ſufficient Warrant for the Juſtification of our Practiſe, in the Obſervation of the Lord's Day, that ſuch was the Practiſe of the Apoſtles, according to thoſe plain Teſtimonies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, recorded in the Holy Scripture, though it be not expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Now if the one half of this Evidence could be brought for the Baptiſm of Infants, we ſhould make no queſtion, but readily ſubſcribe unto it, But Infants Baptiſm not conſiſting with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Chriſt in the Inſtitution; being contrary to the Practice of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and the Apoſtles; there being no Foot-ſteps of it at all in the Scripture; nor till about 200 years after Chriſt's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation; we dare not aſſent unto the Practiſe of it, upon a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Analogy, or Proportion between that and Circumciſion.</p>
            <p>And evident it is, that it is a moſt dangerous Principle upon which they go, that ſo argue; to wit, that in meer poſitive things, ſuch as Circumciſion and Baptiſm are, we may frame an Addition to God's Worſhip from Analogy, or Reſemblance conceived by us, between two Ordinances, whereof one is quite taken away, without any Inſtitution, gathered by Precept, or Apoſtolical Example: For if we may do it in one thing, why not in another? Where ſhall we ſtop? Certain it is, that this very Principle hath brought in all the Popiſh Ceremonies into the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. That which Chriſt and his Apoſtles have taken from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and appointed unto us, we are to receive as they have appointed. But if any others ſhall take upon them to appoint to Mens Conſciences, any Rite, in whole or in part, on their own conceived Reaſon, from Analogy with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies; It is an high Preſumption in ſuch, againſt Chriſt, and againſt the Apoſtles Command to yield to it. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 20. Though
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50207:52"/> it hath <hi>a ſhew of Wiſdom. verſe</hi> 23. And the Apoſtles Example binds us to oppoſe it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 19. But if the Baptiſm of Believers, be the only Baptiſm which Chriſt hath appointed: How comes it to paſs, that ſo many learned and pious Men, ſhould for ſo long a Seaſon, and throughout ſo many Generations cleave to Infants Baptiſm, whilſt ſo few, in Compariſon do embrace the contrary Practiſe?</p>
            <p>For Anſwer hereunto: <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is to be duly noted, that as the Scripture hath clearly foretold us of a Defection, or an Apoſtacy from the Primitive Purity and Simplicity of the Goſpel, in reſpect both of Doctrine and Diſcipline, which was to happen, when the Man of Sin was to be Revealed, and the Myſtery of Iniquity was to be diſcovered in the World; even that Lawleſs one, <hi>who ſhould ſit in the Temple of God, as God; Oppoſing and Exalting himſelf above all that is called God, or that is Worſhipped:</hi> And as <hi>Paul</hi> doth alſo fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn the Elders of the Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> not only, that <hi>grievous Wolves ſhould enter in among them after his Departure, not ſparing the Flock.</hi> But alſo, that <hi>of their own ſelves ſhould Men ariſe, ſpeaking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe things, to draw away Diſciples after them:</hi> Which ſhould leſſen our Wonder in this Reſpect. So it is no leſs obſervable, that as the Apoſtacy came in gradually, the Myſtery of Iniquity prevailing ſtep by ſtep; ſo doth the Wiſdom of the Lord ſeem to order the Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereof. And therefore ſo it is, that in theſe laſt Ages, when the Reformation firſt began to be ſet on foot in the World, the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> part of the Goſpel was firſt notably cleared up, whilſt yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a very great Corruption in point of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> or in reſpect of the Primitive Purity of <hi>Goſpel-Worſhip:</hi> As in the Caſe of <hi>Luther,</hi> and many others of the firſt Reformers, who notwithſtanding their zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Pleading for the Doctrine of free Juſtification, by the Blood of Chriſt, in Oppoſition to Popiſh Merits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet held faſt Images in Churches, Conſubſtantiation, Bowing to the high Altar, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice in Preaching, the Croſs in Baptiſm; and many other things which the After Reformers could not but ſee them, to be clearly defective in. So that the light of God's People comes not up to its proper <hi>Acme</hi> all at once, but by degrees. And ſuitably hath the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation advanced, and the Truths and Ordinances of Chriſt been cleared up, and recovered from the Encroachments, and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Man of Sin:</hi> One Age recovering one part; and another, another; making good that Word, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>The Path of the juſt is as the ſhining Light, that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect Day;</hi> which holds good in reference to the general Diſpenſations of God's Providence toward his People, as well as in particular Caſes.</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:50207:53"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> We muſt follow no Man's Example therefore, no not the Apoſtles themſelves, further than it can be made out unto us, that they were followers of Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. And certain it is, that the Examples of the beſt Men living, will be no ſufficient Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification to us in the matters of Divine Worſhip, when contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an expreſs Word. <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> and <hi>Aſa,</hi> were both good King's of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and great Reformers; yet in many things they did preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricate, and tranſgreſſed the Commandments of the Lord; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in their not removing the <hi>High Places;</hi> and for which they are both taxed by the Holy Spirit, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 14. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. 43. And indeed, as the High Places then ought to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; ſo the ſame ought to have been done by our firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, in reſpect of Infants Baptiſm, and other Ceremonies of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Church: Which other Ceremonies they retained in hope, 'tis true, of gaining over the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to a Compliance with the then E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed Diſcipline; though it ſucceeded far otherwiſe than was expected: For the retaining of thoſe Ceremonies, did but ſo much the more harden the Papal Party in their other Devices. We muſt follow no mans Example therefore, againſt the Word of God, upon an undue Preſumption, that any of the Sons of Men, how Pious or Learned ſoever, are infallible, either in point of Doctrine or Practiſe. <hi>Humanum eſt errare,</hi> muſt not be forgotten.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> To lay the ſtreſs of your Argument, upon the Unlikely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that ſo great a Number of God's People, in ſo many Ages, ſhould be left in the dark, in Reference to ſuch a Goſpel Ordinance as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is; As it proceeds from the want of a due Conſideration of that Apoſtacy of the Church from its Primitive Purity, in reſpect both of Doctrine and Worſhip, which the Scripture do ſo clearly foretel us concerning: So the Language of it ſounds no other than this; That we cannot miſs of doing right and well, if we follow the Pious Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of thoſe that are gone before us; not conſidering that as they were Men, and Men of like Infirmities with our ſelves: So that it no way follows, that becauſe there is a beginning Reformation, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the forementioned Apoſtacy, we muſt go no further. True it is, that we are to give no Entertainment unto any New Light or Doctrine in theſe Reſpects, that hath not been already declared unto us in the Holy Scriptures: But if upon a due ſearch it can be made appear unto us from the Word of God, that we have hitherto gone aſtray in a point of ſuch Importance to the Worſhip and Service of God, as Baptiſm is: As we ought not to ſhut our Eyes againſt the Light ſo ſhining upon us; ſo it will not excuſe our Continuance in ſuch a Path of Errour, that we have the Company of ſo many Wiſe, Learned, and Holy Men, that are therein Fellow Tranſgreſſours with us.</p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:50207:53"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> We have not been without the Teſtimony of many Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Pious, and Holy Men, who have born Witneſs unto the Truth we are now pleading for, and that in many former Ages, as well as in this. For it is well known that Infants Baptiſm was very early op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, if not ſo ſoon as it was born; for no Antiquity mentions it to have had any peaceable being in the World any long time before it was oppoſed: And if it be ſaid that it was not oppoſed at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, aſſoon as it came into the World; it may be ſo: For Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Whilſt the Servants ſlept the Evil One Sowed Tares.</hi> And ſurely it was a ſleepy Time amongſt Chriſtians when it came in; but when they began to awake they oppoſed it. Beſides which,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly.</hi> We have the Witneſs of ſome of your own Party, whoſe Tongues and Pens God hath (at leaſt) ſo over-ruled, that they have born a Famous Teſtimony for our Practiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> ſaith; <q>This indeed is true Baptiſm, when it is both in the <hi>Symbol</hi> and the <hi>Myſtery.</hi> Whatſoever is leſs than this, is but the <hi>Symbole</hi> only, and a meer <hi>Ceremony;</hi> an <hi>Opus Operatum;</hi> a dead Letter; an empty Shadow; an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> without an <hi>Agent</hi> to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age it. <hi>Lib. of Proph</hi> p. 242.</q>

               <q>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> Baptiſm is never propounded, mentioned, or enjoyned, as a means of Remiſſion of Sins, or of Eternal Life; but ſomething of <hi>Duty, Choice,</hi> and <hi>Sanctity,</hi> is joined with it, in order to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the end ſo mentioned. <hi>p.</hi> 243.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> They that Baptize Children, make Baptiſm to be wholly an <hi>Outward Duty;</hi> a Work of the <hi>Law;</hi> a <hi>Carnal</hi> Ordinance: It makes us adhere to the <hi>Letter,</hi> without regard to the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and to Relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the <hi>Myſteriouſneſs,</hi> the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> the <hi>Spirituality</hi> of the Goſpel. Which Argument is of ſo much the more Conſideration; becauſe under the <hi>Spiritual Covenant</hi> of the Goſpel of Grace; if the <hi>Myſtery</hi> goes not <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Symbole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> (which it doth when the <hi>Symboles</hi> are <hi>Cognations</hi> of Grace, as the <hi>Sacraments</hi> are;) yet it always <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies</hi> it; but never <hi>follows</hi> in Order of Time, and is clear in the perpetual <hi>Analogy</hi> of Holy Scripture.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the words mentioned in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. (which are the only Records of the Promiſes) are interpreted upon a weak miſtake. <hi>The Promiſe belongs to you and your Children:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Infants</hi> are actually Receptive of it in that <hi>Capacity.</hi> That is the Argument: But the Reaſon of it is not yet diſcovered; nor ever will: For <hi>(to you and your Children)</hi> is to you and your <hi>Poſterity;</hi> to you and <hi>your Children,</hi> when they are of the <hi>ſame Capacity,</hi> in which you <hi>are,</hi> receptive of the Promiſe. But he that whenever the Word <hi>Children</hi> is Expreſt, underſtands <hi>Infants,</hi> muſt needs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that in all <hi>Iſrael</hi> there were <hi>no Men;</hi> but all were <hi>Infants:</hi> And
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50207:54"/> if that had been true, it had been the greater wonder that they ſhould overcome the <hi>Anakims,</hi> and beat the King of <hi>Moab,</hi> and March ſo far, and Diſcourſe ſo well, for they were all called <hi>the Children of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>p.</hi> 233.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly.</hi> Whereas 'tis Argued from the Commiſſion. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 6. <hi>He that Believeth and is Baptized ſhall be Saved.</hi> Infants are Believers, and therefore according to the Commiſſion they are to be Baptized. <q>Whether Infants <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> have Faith or no, is a Queſtion to be diſputed by Perſons that Care not <hi>how much</hi> they <hi>ſay,</hi> and <hi>how little</hi> they <hi>prove.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Perſonal</hi> and <hi>Actual</hi> Faith they have none: For they have no Acts of Underſtanding: And beſides, how can any Man know that they have, ſince he never ſaw any ſign of it, neither was he told ſo by any that could tell? <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some ſay they have <hi>Imputative;</hi> but then ſo let the <hi>Sacrament</hi> be to; that is, if they have the <hi>Parents Faith,</hi> or the <hi>Churches,</hi> then ſo let <hi>Baptiſm</hi> be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted alſo by Derivation from them; And as in their Mothers Womb, and while they hung on their Mothers Breaſts, they live upon their Mothers Nouriſhment: So they may upon the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or their Mother the Church: For ſince Faith is neceſſary to Baptiſm (and they themſelves confeſs it by ſtriving to find out new Kinds of Faith to dawb the matter up;) ſuch as the <hi>Faith,</hi> ſuch muſt be the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> for there is no Proportion, between an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual</hi> Sacrament, and an <hi>Imputative</hi> Faith; <hi>this</hi> being an immediate and neceſſary Order to <hi>that.</hi> And whatſoever can be ſaid to take off from the neceſſity of <hi>Actual</hi> Faith; all that and much more may be ſaid to excuſe from the <hi>Actual</hi> Suſception of Baptiſm. The <hi>firſt of theſe Devices,</hi> was that of <hi>Luther,</hi> and his Scholars; <hi>the ſecond</hi> of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> and his. And yet there is a <hi>Third Device,</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Teaches, and that is. that Infants have <hi>Habitual Faith,</hi> but who told them ſo? How can they prove it? What Revelation or Reaſon teacheth any ſuch thing? Are they by this Habit ſo much as diſpoſed to an Actual Belief, without a Miracle? Can an Infant, ſent into a <hi>Mahometan</hi> Province be more confident for Chriſtianity, when he comes to be a Man, than if he had not been Baptized? Are there any Acts precedent, concomitant, or conſequent to this pretended Habit? This ſtrange Invention is abſolutely without Art, without Scripture, Reaſon, or Authority; but the Men are to be excuſed unleſs there were a better. <hi>p.</hi> 240.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To which, <hi>(ſaith he,)</hi> This Conſideration may be added; that if <hi>Baptiſm</hi> be neceſſary to the Salvation of Infants <hi>(as the Fathers of Old,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>England ſince)</hi> upon whom is the Impoſition laid? To whom is the Command given? To the Parents or the Children? Not to the Parents, for then God hath put the Salvation of Innocent Babes into the Power of <hi>others,</hi> and Infants
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50207:54"/> may be damned for their Fathers Careleſsneſs, or Malice. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that it is not neceſſary at all to be done to them, to whom it cannot be preſcribed as <hi>a Law,</hi> and in whoſe behalf it cannot be reaſonably entruſted to <hi>others</hi> with the Apendant Neceſſity: And if it be not <hi>neceſſary,</hi> it is certain it is not <hi>Reaſonable;</hi> and moſt certain it is no where in <hi>terms preſcribed;</hi> and therefore it is preſumed that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> ought to be underſtood and adminiſtred, according as other Precepts are, with Reference to the <hi>Capacity</hi> of the Subject, and the <hi>Reaſonableneſs</hi> of the thing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And again, <hi>p.</hi> 242. <q>If any Man runs for Succour to that exploded <hi>Creſphugeton,</hi> that Infants have Faith, or any other inſpired Habit, of I know not what or how; we deſire no more Advantage in the World, than that they are conſtrained to anſwer without Revelation againſt Reaſon, common Senſe, and all the Experience in the World.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Sixthly.</hi> But Tradition <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> by all means muſt ſupply the place of Scripture; and there is pretended a <hi>Tradition</hi> Apoſtolical, that Infants were Baptized. But at this <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> we are not much moved; for we who rely upon the written Word of God, as ſuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to eſtabliſh all true Religion, do not value the Allegation of Tradition. And however the World goes, none of the <hi>Reſormed</hi> Churches can pretend this Argument for this Opinion: Becauſe they who reject <hi>Tradition,</hi> when it is againſt them, muſt not pretend it in the leaſt for them. But if we will allow the <hi>Topick</hi> to be good; yet how will it be verified? For ſo far as can yet appear, it relies wholly upon the Teſtimony of <hi>Origen;</hi> for from him <hi>Auſtin</hi> had it.

Beſides having been already Baptized in our Infancy, what neceſſity is there for the Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition thereof? It being an approved Maxim, that that which ought not to be done, being done, ought not to be undone.</p>
            <p>We Anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> whereas you tell us, that neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor Un<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>circumciſion, but a new Creature. Certain it is, that <hi>once</hi> Circumciſion was ſomething, when the Lord would have killed <hi>Moſes</hi> becauſe of the Circumciſion. <hi>Exod</hi> 4. 24, 26. And when the Lord ſaid, <hi>That whoſoever was not Circumciſed ſhould be cut off from his People. Gen.</hi> 17. 14. True it is, that now under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel it is nothing, becauſe Aboliſhed. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>If you be Circumciſed Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing:</hi> But ſhall we therefore ſay that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is nothing?

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> We cannot be juſtly affirmed to have placed more ſtreſs on the Ordinance inſiſted on, than the Scripture it ſelf chargeth on it. In which reſpect it ought to be conſidered, what our Saviour himſelf ſpeaks, when he was to be Baptized by <hi>John,</hi> after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we are now pleading for. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Suffer it to be ſo now: For thus it becometh to fulfil all Righteouſneſs.</hi> And what is that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Holineſs which God now requireth of us; but our anſwerable Conformity to the revealed Will of God; and that both in reſpect of the Duties of the <hi>firſt,</hi> as well as the <hi>Second</hi> Table? Upon which account we ought further to conſider, what a ſpecial charge our Lord Jeſus left with his Apoſtles upon his Departure hence; That they ſhould teach the Nations <hi>to obſerve all things, whatſoever he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:50207:56"/> 
               <hi>them.</hi> And this of Believers Baptiſm amongſt the reſt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. And elſewhere <hi>Paul</hi> commends the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> for that they had kept the Ordinances <hi>as they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto them,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 2. It is therefore certainly an undue Reflection, when you ſuppoſe, that we place too much ſtreſs upon an Ordinance of Chriſt; while we plead for the <hi>Purity</hi> of its Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, according to the <hi>Primitive</hi> Inſtitution. It was our Saviours paſſionate Expreſſion to his Diſciples. <hi>John</hi> 14. 15. <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 15. 14. <hi>Ye are my Friends. if ye do whatſoever I Command you.</hi> We cannot therefore expreſs our Friendſhip to Chriſt as we ought, if we are negligent on this <hi>Account.</hi> And certain it is, that as we cannot expreſs our Love to Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, if we do not <hi>whatſoever</hi> he hath commanded us: So if we do it not as he hath commanded us; for if God were ſo ſtrict as we all know he was upon this Account, under the former Adminiſtration; we cannot rationally expect to be Indulged in a known Deviation. in reſpect of any part of that Worſhip which he hath <hi>now</hi> Preſcribed unto us. Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, reſpecting our Duty both to God and Man, is indeed indiſpenſibly required of us; and it cannot be denied, but that the Baptiſm of Believers we are now pleading for, is a <hi>main</hi> part thereof; it being that <hi>Homage</hi> or <hi>Worſhip</hi> which we do more immediately perform, and offer up unto the great God: So that we place no more ſtreſs thereon, than the matter requires; we dare not indeed lay that ſtreſs upon it; as ſome of our Adverſaries in this point have done, who have made it <hi>abſolutely neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi> From a groſs Miſunderſtanding of that Text. <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a Man be born of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> but though an <hi>Ignorant,</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwilling</hi> neglect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, will not unavoidably ſhut us out from God's preſence; yet ſince Chriſt hath commanded it, and hath promiſed his preſence to his People in the due performance of it, it cannot be denied, but that we are infinitely obliged to be found in an anſwerable Practiſe. And therefore;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly;</hi> Whereas you tell us, that having been already Baptized in your <hi>Infancy,</hi> you reckon there is no neceſſity lying on you, to be again Baptized; We Anſwer, that it is no way ſafe for any to reſt Contented with that <hi>Pretended</hi> Baptiſm they received in their <hi>Infancie,</hi> It being a meer <hi>Nullity</hi> in reſpect of the New Teſtament Ordinance of Baptiſm. And the Reaſon is plain, becauſe there was that wanting in it, which is Abſolutely <hi>Eſſential</hi> thereunto. For when you Baptize <hi>Infants,</hi> or were your ſelves baptized in that <hi>Capacity,</hi> by ſprinkling a little Water only on the Face, there was a manifeſt failure, Firſt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50207:56"/> in reſpect of the <hi>right Subject;</hi> and Secondly in reſpect of the <hi>right form</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> of the Adminiſtration of that Ordinance.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In reſpect of the right <hi>Subject,</hi> which muſt be qualified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Inſtitution;</hi> that is, the Perſon to be Baptized, ought to be a <hi>Believer;</hi> or at leaſt one that makes an <hi>External Profeſſion</hi> of Faith in Chriſt, as hath been already proved from <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now unleſs you can demonſtrate that at the time when Baptiſm was Adminiſtred to you in your <hi>Infant ſtate,</hi> you were then <hi>Actual Believers;</hi> or at leaſt that you did then make ſome ſenſible <hi>Profeſſion</hi> thereof, you were not according to Chriſt's Rule, the right or proper Subjects of ſuch an Ordinance.</p>
            <p>Secondly; In reſpect of the <hi>External Mode,</hi> or <hi>Form of its Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration;</hi> which if we conſult the Scripture Rule, is not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by <hi>ſprinkling</hi> or pouring a little Water upon the <hi>Face only;</hi> but by <hi>dipping the whole Perſon under Water, and raiſing him up again,</hi> to Figure out unto us, our Communion with Chriſt, in His Death, Burial, and Reſurrection. And that the Manner and Ceremony of Baptiſm ought to be by <hi>dipping</hi> or <hi>plunging the whole Body under Water;</hi> and not by <hi>ſprinkling</hi> or <hi>pouring</hi> a little Water only on the <hi>Face</hi> or <hi>Head</hi> (as hath been commonly <hi>uſed,</hi> ſince the <hi>Subjects</hi> have been changed from <hi>Men</hi> to <hi>Babes;)</hi> is thus made good.</p>
            <p>Firſt from the <hi>proper</hi> and genuine Signification of the <hi>Word,</hi> ſo well agreeing with the <hi>ends</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> the <hi>Ceremony</hi> with the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> and the <hi>Sign</hi> with the <hi>thing ſignified.</hi> The Word we call <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> and the Latins <hi>Baptiſmus,</hi> is no other than the Greek Word <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> in his Book de Baptiſmo, Tom. 1. p. 71. 72. Speaking of the ſignification of the Word. <hi>Baptiſmus Graecum eſt, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine poteſt verti merſio, cum Immergimus aliquid in Aqua ut totum tegatur Aqua, &amp; quamvis ille mos aboleverit, apud plereſ<expan>

                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> debeant tamen pror<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus immergi, &amp; ſtatim retrahi &amp; ſane ſi Spectes quid Baptiſmus ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, idem requiri videbis.</hi> That is, Baptiſm is a Greek Word, and may be Interpreted an Over-whelming, when we plunge any thing into the Water, that it may be covered all over. And although that Cuſtom is now out of uſe with many, yet they ought truly to be dipt, and preſently lifted up again. And certainly if you conſider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, you will ſee that to be neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Secondly. It is very conſiderable how Emphatically this Senſe and Signification of the Word is confirmed unto us, by the ſeveral Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors uſed by the Holy Spirit in Scripture, in alluſion hereto. <hi>viz.</hi> when <hi>Perſons</hi> are Implunged into great Afflictions, they are ſaid to be <hi>Baptized</hi> therein. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 38. And ſo for Perſons that were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with great meaſures of the Spirit, they are ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>be Baptized</hi> therewith. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 5. The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being encompaſſed with the Cloud over their Head, and the divided Sea on both ſides, were ſaid to <hi>be Baptized</hi> in the Cloud, and in the Sea. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. And Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Perſons are ſaid to be Dead and Buried, in alluſion to putting Men into the Earth, and covering them therewith. None of which can be figured by the ſprinkling of a little Water upon the Face.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. It appears to be ſo from the Practice and Uſage we find hereof in Scripture; and the Opinion of the Learned upon it.</p>
            <p>Firſt in the Story of <hi>Chriſt's Baptiſm,</hi> we read <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>That Jeſus came from</hi> Galilee <hi>to</hi> Jordan <hi>unto</hi> John <hi>to be Baptized of him.</hi> And ver. 16. <hi>When he was Baptized, he went up ſtraitway out of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> The Learned <hi>Cajetan</hi> upon the place ſaith; <hi>Chriſt aſcended out of the Water; therefore Chriſt was Baptized by</hi> John, <hi>not by ſprinkling, or</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:50207:57" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>by pouring Water upon him; but by Immerſion, that is by dipping or plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Second Scripture conſiderable is that of <hi>John.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>And</hi> John <hi>was Baptizing in</hi> Aenon <hi>near</hi> Salim: And the Reaſon why he pitch'd upon this place is given; <hi>becauſe there was much Water there. Piſcator</hi> upon the place, tells us: <hi>This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is mentioned to ſignifie the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of Baptiſm, which</hi> John <hi>uſed in Dipping or Plunging the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a Man ſtanding in the River; Whence he ſaith, Chriſt being Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by</hi> John <hi>in</hi> Jordan, <hi>is ſaid to aſcend out of the Water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Third Scripture worthy our notice is, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 36. 38. <hi>As they went on their way, they came unto a certain Water, and the</hi> Enuch <hi>ſaid; See here is Water, and they went down both into the Water, both</hi> Philip <hi>and the</hi> Enuch, <hi>and he Baptized him. And when they were come up out of the Water,</hi> &amp;c. Upon which place <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith; <hi>We ſee what Faſhion the Ancients had to Adminiſter Baptiſm; for they Plunged the whole Body into the Water. The uſe is now (ſaith he) that the Miniſter caſts a little Water only upon the Body, or upon the Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Fourth Scripture we ſhall mention, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>Buried with Him in Baptiſm:</hi> Where the Apoſtle elegantly alludes to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Baptizing into Death, and Reſurrection with Chriſt. <hi>Cajean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> upon the place ſaith; <hi>Thus we are</hi> Buried <hi>with Him by Baptiſm into Death; by our Burying he declares our Death from the Ceremony of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; becauſe he who is Baptized is put under the Water, and by this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a Similitude of him that is buried, who is put under the Earth. Now becauſe none are buried but dead Men; from this very thing that we are buried in Baptiſm, we are Aſſimulated to Chriſt buried, or when he was buried.</hi> Keckerman Syſt. Theol. l. 3. c. 8. <hi>Says that Immerſion, not Aſperſion, was the firſt Inſtitution of Baptiſm, as it doth plainly appear from</hi> Rom. 6. 3. <hi>The</hi> Aſſemblies <hi>Annotations upon the place do ſay, That in this Phraſe the Apoſtle ſeemeth to allude to the Ancient manner of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, which was to dip the Party Baptized, and as it were to bury them under Water for a while, and then to raiſe them up again out of it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Burial of the Old Man, and our Reſurrection to newneſs of Life.</hi> The like ſaith <hi>Piſcator</hi> and <hi>Diodate upon the place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> alſo a great Searcher into <hi>Antiquity,</hi> in his late Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Primitive Chriſtianity</hi> ſaith, p. 320. <hi>That the Party Baptized was wholly Immerged, or put under Water, which was the almoſt conſtant, and univerſal Cuſtom of thoſe times; whereby they did moſt notably, and ſignificantly expreſs the great end and effect of Baptiſm,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And moſt remarkable is the Teſtimony that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf gives to this Truth. <hi>As to the manner</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>It is commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by us to the Anabaptiſts, as our Commentators declare; That in the Apoſtles times, the Baptized were dipped over Head in Water; though we</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:50207:58"/> 
               <hi>have thought it lawful to diſ-uſe the manner of dipping, and to uſe leſs Water.</hi> In his Third Argument againſt Mr. <hi>Blake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which Arguments, from the <hi>Genuine Senſe</hi> of the Word <hi>Nature</hi> of the Ordinance, uſage of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> were excellently Inculcated by the Learned Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> in a Sermon Preached at the Lecture in <hi>Michael's Cornhill, London. April</hi> 15, 1673. From <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are Buried with Him by Baptiſm into Death,</hi> &amp;c. Proving from thence <hi>that Dipping or Plunging was the proper Ceremony and Rite in the Ordinance. And how</hi> naturally <hi>Arguments did ariſe from that</hi> Sign <hi>in Baptiſm, to inforce</hi> Holineſs <hi>and</hi> Mortification, <hi>the Thing</hi> Signified <hi>thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore to alter this Rite from <hi>Dipping</hi> to <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> ſpoils quite the <hi>Symbole,</hi> and makes it another thing. And you may as well take a Wafer Cake, or a whole Loaf to repreſent Chriſt's broken Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as ſprinkling a little Water to repreſent or figure out, his and our Death, Burial, and Reſurrection by. And how cometh it to paſs that many are ſo exactly curious, about that other Ordinance of the <hi>Supper,</hi> ſo as to make the geſture of Kneeling a ground of Separ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; and yet to be ſo Negligent and Inconſiderate in <hi>this?</hi> And if it be Evil in Papiſts <hi>not to break Bread, nor to Eat,</hi> but to lift up, ſhew, and Swallow down whole the Hoſt; when Chriſt did <hi>break Bread,</hi> and bade <hi>eat it;</hi> then it neceſſarily follows that it is as Evil when He bids <hi>Baptize,</hi> not to do it, but to <hi>Rantize;</hi> and inſtead of Baptizing into the Name of Chriſt, Dead and Riſen, to Water him that hath no Underſtanding thereof: So that when the Miniſter ſaith, <hi>I Baptize thee,</hi> to an Infant, and doth no more, he ſpeaketh that which is not <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>deceives</hi> thoſe that take it at his Word for <hi>Chriſtian Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that thus then we have diſtinctly and plainly proved you to be defective both in reſpect of the <hi>Internal,</hi> and <hi>External Conſtituent</hi> parts of this great Ordinance; that is both in <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form;</hi> both which are <hi>Eſſentially</hi> requiſite to the true <hi>Conſtitution</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> of it: by which it is manifeſt, that Infants Baptiſm is a meer <hi>Nullity,</hi> and that which <hi>Chriſt will not own.</hi> And if it be ſaid, that the <hi>right Words</hi> of Baptiſm were uſed, it being done <hi>in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</hi> We Anſwer, that ſo there was alſo in Baptizing of <hi>Bells,</hi> and <hi>Churches;</hi> which yet in your own Judgment is ſo far from making it a <hi>right Ordinance,</hi> the <hi>true Subject</hi> being wanting, that it is no leſs than a great <hi>Prophanation</hi> thereof, and a miſerable taking <hi>the Name of God in vain.</hi> And therefore certainly Jeſus Chriſt one Day will diſcover that he takes it not kindly at the Hands of his Profeſſed Friends, that of their <hi>own Heads,</hi> and without <hi>his Warrant,</hi> upon a Preſumptuous Suppoſition of <hi>unwritten Indulgence,</hi> having taken it upon them to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Subject, as well as the <hi>manner</hi> of the Adminiſtration of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance ſo <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Venerable</hi> as Baptiſm is.</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:50207:58"/>
            <p> As for the Cavils of <hi>unſeemlineſs, and hazarding of Health to the weak,</hi> in the way of our preſent Practice; as they are the Fruits of <hi>Carnal Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief;</hi> ſo it is no other than to reproach the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of Chriſt that ſo Ordained it; telling us (however the World may call it undecent) yet that thus it becometh us, as it did himſelf, to fulfill all <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> And as they that have or ſhall ſee the Decency of the Practice, will find Cauſe ſufficiently to Vindicate it from the Reproach of Unſeemlineſs, and be able to convince Gainſayers of their Unchriſtian Slauders in that Reſpect: So as for the hazarding of Health to the Weak; the conſtant, and known Experience of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, doth amply refute it as a groundleſs Suggeſtion.</p>

               <head>SECT. I.</head>
               <p>WE ſhall begin with Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi>'s Treatiſe. And <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whereas Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> pretending to Anſwer that Argument of ours. <hi>That there is no expreſs Command, nor any poſitive Example in all the New Teſtament, concerning the Baptiſm of Infants.</hi> For the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation thereof, He tells us, <hi>That this Argument is built on this falſe Principle; That no direct Conſequences from Scripture are Mandatory, and ſo obliging and of Divine Authority.</hi> Whereas we affirm no ſuch thing,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50207:59"/> but only ſay; <hi>That in all Poſitive or Inſtituted Worſhip, ſuch as Baptiſm is, which hath no other Rule nor Reaſon, than the meer will of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, there muſt be either an expreſs Command, or an expreſs Example to enforce it.</hi> In all other Reſpects we juſtly allow ſuch proper Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences as are deducible from the Scriptures, for the enforcing of Duty, or for the Comfort of God's People: For therefore is Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Expounding, and Searching the Scripture appointed unto us. But as it would have been a Sin for <hi>Abraham,</hi> upon bare Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces only, and without an expreſs Warrant, to have Circumciſed his Children: So it would be no leſs to us, without the ſame Divine Warrant, in reſpect of Baptiſm. And therefore Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> doth not well to ſay; <hi>That we may as well argue, That becauſe</hi> Abraham <hi>was Circumciſed when</hi> 99 <hi>Years old; Therefore old Perſons are to be Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and none elſe: As becauſe grown Perſons. were Baptized, therefore not Infants.</hi> Whereas he knew, <hi>Abraham</hi> had an expreſs Command, as for the Circumciſion of himſelf, ſo for his Infants alſo: Which is that which we juſtly affirm to be wanting under the Goſpel, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Baptiſm.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
               <head>SECT. II.</head>
               <p>§ 1. BUT then Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> doth alſo tell us; <hi>That it is to be conſidered, that there is nothing in all the New Teſtament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Baptizing of Infants; no hint from any expreſs Word dropt from Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, nor any Phraſe, which doth forbid ſuch an Act.</hi> p. 1. And this Argument, both he and others do lay very much ſtreſs upon. But then Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> ſhould have conſidered; That it is the Opinion of divers able and godly Divines: That what is not commanded in the Worſhip of God, is forbidden: And that every Affirmative command of Chriſt, includes a Negative. For (ſaith <hi>Tertullian) This is a certain Rule; if it be ſaid 'tis lawful, becauſe the Scripture doth not forbid it; It may equally be Retorted; It is therefore not lawful, becauſe the Scripture doth not command it.</hi> And herein there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſiſted the Sin of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu, Lev.</hi> 10. who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed for offering ſtrange Fire, <hi>which God had not Commanded.</hi> They might have ſaid, <hi>Lord 'tis true, Thou haſt not commanded this ſtrange Fire:</hi> But as thou haſt not <hi>Commanded</hi> it; ſo neither haſt thou <hi>Forbidden</hi> it. And by the ſame Reaſon might <hi>Abraham</hi> have Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed his Children on the ſeventh day, as well as on the eighth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had not forbidden it. For though God had commanded it to be done on the eighth day; yet he had no where expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the ſeventh. But ſince the eighth day was expreſly appointed,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50207:60"/> and not the ſeventh, though the ſeventh was no where expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> was bound to the former, and not to the latter; and it would have been his Sin to have varied from the Rule preſcribed him. In like manner we ſay; The Baptiſm of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers is expreſly commanded; That of Infants is not commanded; and therefore though it be not forbidden, yet ſince 'tis not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, it would be our Sin to practiſe it. And ſo in the Paſſeover: Whereas God commanded a Lamb, a Male of the firſt year to be eaten; they might as well have made uſe of an Ewe, or a Ram of the ſecond or third Year, becauſe not forbidden; no expreſs Word of God had forbidden it. So when <hi>David</hi> and the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had made a new Cart for the Carriage of the Ark, which was to have been born on the Prieſts Shoulders only; and when God ſmote <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> for holding the Ark, they might as well have Pleaded, that neither of theſe was expreſly forbidden: But yet nevertheleſs, <hi>For this Cauſe the Lord made a Breach upon them, for that they did not ſeek him after the due order</hi> that he had expreſly appointed, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 13.</p>
               <p>§ 2. We find no where in all the Scriptures; That ever any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Word dropt from Chriſt or his Apoſtles, to the Prohibiting or Forbidding of Crucifixes, Beads, Altars, Praying to Saints, Pictures in Churches, Pilgrimages. Which things are ſtill in uſe among <hi>Papiſts;</hi> but diſowned by Proteſtants, becauſe not commanded, though not expreſly forbidden. The like may be ſaid concerning Bowing at the Name of Jeſus; the Croſs in Baptiſm; Surplices in Preaching; Kneeling at the Sacrament; ſet Forms of Prayer. In reſpect of which it is no proper Argument; that therefore theſe things are lawful to be uſed in the Divine Service, becauſe not forbidden; For as they are not forbidden, ſo neither are they commanded: Which is the very Argument made uſe of by the Generality of Diſſenters, for their Juſtification, in Oppoſition to Prelatical Incroachments. <hi>And therefore thou art Inexcuſable O Man! For wherein thou Judgeſt another, thou Condemneſt thy ſelf,</hi> Rom. 2. 1. There is no expreſs Word of God againſt the Communicating of Infants in the Lord's Supper; And yet you your ſelves do not therefore count it lawful to admit them to that Ordinance, without an expreſs Word to that purpoſe. And laſtly, Bells are not expreſly forbidden to be Baptized; and yet we do not reckon that a ſufficient Argument for ſuch a Practiſe. And whereas it is Objected as to this; That Bells are not <hi>Subjectum Capax:</hi> A fit or capable Subject for ſuch an Ordinance, we would then ask, wherein lies their Incapacity? Cannot a Miniſter ſprinkle a little Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon a Bell, and uſe the Words of the Inſtitution in as ſolemn a manner as he does when he Baptizes a Child? Or are they incapable for want of an Inſtitution? We ſay the ſame of Infants. And if you ſay; they are not capable of the uſes and ends of Baptiſm, as Men
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50207:60"/> are; We Anſwer, If God had pleaſed, He could have made them by an Inſtitution, capable of ſome ſacred Uſefulneſs; yea, capable of Relative Holineſs, as well as <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Bell: Or the Bells mentioned, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. 20. upon which it was written; <hi>Holineſs to the Lord.</hi> But it is well known, there are thoſe in the World, who think themſelves as wiſe as others, that judge Bells capable Subjects of Baptiſm, and have done ſo diverſe Ages.</p>
               <p>§ 3. Thus you ſee what Abſurdities follow this Poſition, That <hi>thoſe things are lawful in God's Worſhip, which are not forbidden by any expreſs Word, dropt from Chriſt or his Apoſtles.</hi> But ſurely God is more <hi>jealous</hi> of his <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>tender</hi> of his <hi>Worſhip,</hi> than to leave it to <hi>Our</hi> Pleaſure. And that God hath in all Ages teſtified his diſlike, yea, Abhorrence of <hi>Will-Worſhip,</hi> and that for this very Reaſon, becauſe he hath <hi>not Commanded it,</hi> is too evident to be denied. For this cauſe God threatens Judgments upon his People of Old. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43. 8. <hi>They have ſet their Threſholds by my Threſhold, and their Poſts by my Poſt; wherefore I have Conſumed them in mine Anger.</hi> Wherein we cannot but obſerve, that God diſcovers his ſevere diſpleaſure againſt them, not for neglecting any part of his Worſhip that <hi>he had Commanded them:</hi> But for their <hi>Preſumption</hi> in <hi>adding</hi> ſomething thereto, which <hi>he had not Commanded them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 4. And indeed <hi>Will-Worſhip</hi> muſt needs be a great Sin, when the ſame Perſon who is to perform the <hi>Obedience,</hi> ſhall dare to appoint the <hi>Laws;</hi> Implying a peremptory Purpoſe of no further <hi>Obſervance,</hi> than may conſiſt with the Allowance of his <hi>own Judgment:</hi> Whereas true Obedience muſt be grounded on the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of that Power that <hi>Commands;</hi> not on the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> or Benefit of the Precept propoſed. Divine Laws, ſuch as are the <hi>Poſitive Inſtitutions concerning God's Worſhip,</hi> require Obedience not ſo much from the <hi>Quality</hi> of the things commanded, as from the <hi>Authority</hi> of him that commands them. We are all Servants of God; and Servants are but living Inſtruments, whoſe Property is to be governed by the Will of thoſe in whoſe Peſſeſſion they are. <hi>Will-Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,</hi> well they may flatter <hi>God;</hi> they cannot pleaſe him. He that requires us to deny our ſelves in his Service, doth therein teach us, that his Commands ſtand rather in <hi>fear</hi> than in <hi>need</hi> of us; In fear of our <hi>Boldneſs,</hi> leſt we abuſe them; not in need of our <hi>Judgment</hi> to <hi>Poliſh</hi> or <hi>Alter</hi> them. The Conqueſt of an Enemy without the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> of the General, coſt a <hi>Roman</hi> Gentleman his Life, though his <hi>own Father</hi> were the Judge. So the over-wiſe Induſtry of the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, in bringing not the <hi>ſame,</hi> but as he thought, a fitter piece of Timber than he was commanded to the <hi>Roman Conſul,</hi> was rewarded with nothing but a <hi>Bundle of Rods.</hi> So jealous and diſpleaſed are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven men themſelves, to have their Laws undervalued by the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50207:61"/> private Judgments of thoſe who rather <hi>Interpret</hi> than <hi>Obey</hi> them. Much more <hi>Impious</hi> then will it be for us, to mix <hi>Humane Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and Appointments of our own, with the <hi>Inſtitutions of God,</hi> and to Impoſe them as Divine Duties, with a neceſſity of Obedience; whilſt by that means, we take Chriſt's Divine <hi>Prerogative</hi> out of his Hands, and make our ſelves <hi>joynt Authors</hi> of his Ordinances, or rather the <hi>Deſtroyers</hi> of them: For to practiſe an Ordinance otherwiſe than Chriſt hath Inſtituted, is not to honour <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Appointments; but an <hi>Idol</hi> of our own making. Now this the Apoſtles durſt not do. They tell us, <hi>that they declared the Counſel of God,</hi> but nothing elſe. And <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he delivered nothing unto them, but what <hi>he had received from the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. And ſure he did not receive Inſants Baptiſm from the Lord: For he never declares it to them.</p>
               <p>§ 5. This therefore ſhould be a Boundary to all Chriſt's Miniſters, that they deliver nothing to the People, but what they have <hi>recieved from the Lord.</hi> That Faith that was <hi>once delivered to the Saints,</hi> muſt be Preached and contended for, but nothing elſe. And if Chriſt's Miniſters have not received Infants Baptiſm from the Lord; and if they cannot prove that it was once delivered to the Saints, it is not to be Preached. As for all humane Mixtures in God's Worſhip, they are uſeful only for theſe two purpoſes, either to ſlacken and abate ſomething that is <hi>Exceſſive,</hi> or to ſupply ſomething that is <hi>Deficient.</hi> And ſo all Heterogenious Mixtures do plainly intimate, either a <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs</hi> to be <hi>Corrected,</hi> or a <hi>Defect</hi> to be <hi>Supplied.</hi> Now it were a great Impiety to charge either of theſe upon the pure and perfect Word of God; and by Conſequence to uſe Deceit, by Adulterating of it, either by ſuch Gloſſes, as diminiſh and take away the force of it; or by the Addition of Humane Traditions, as may argue any defect. So that to ſtamp any thing of a Humane Original, with a Divine Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and obtrude it upon the Conſciences of Men; to take any dead Child of ours, as the Harlot did, and lay it in the Boſom of the Scripture, and Father it upon God; to build any Structure of ours in the Road to Heaven, and to ſtop up the Way; is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Preſumptions that the Pride of Man can aſpire unto. To Erect a Throne in the Conſciences of his Fellow Creatures, and to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit the great Seal of Heaven, for the countenancing of his Forgeries, is a Sin moſt ſeverely provided againſt by God, with ſpecial Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Threatnings. See Deut. 12. 32. <hi>What thing ſoever I Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you, obſerve to do it; Thou ſhalt not add thereunto, nor diminiſh from it.</hi> Deut. 18. 20. <hi>The Prophet that ſhall ſpeak a Word in my Name that I have not Commanded, even that Prophet ſhall die.</hi> Prov. 30. 6. <hi>Add not unto his Words, leſt he Reprove thee, and thou be found a Liar.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:50207:61"/>
               <p> § 6. And yet further to demonſtrate, <hi>That Will Worſhip is a Sin of no ſmall Magnitude,</hi> conſider the following Particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> It clearly proceeds as the Fruit of Pride. Men Love to have ſomething of their own in God's Worſhip. They are not content with what the Infinite Wiſe God <hi>commands</hi> them; but will Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly be adding ſomething of their own thereto. The Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment ſhews that Man is prone to be <hi>medling</hi> and <hi>making</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Worſhip, till he <hi>marres</hi> all. <hi>Iſrael provoked God with their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.</hi> Pſal. 106. 29.</p>
               <p>Secondly. <hi>Will Worſhip is a Sin greatly diſpleaſing to God:</hi> For God is not <hi>pleaſed</hi> with any thing in Worſhip which is not his <hi>own:</hi> Nay the contrary is that which he hath ſignified to be greatly provoking to him. In this Reſpect, it is not the <hi>Work of Mens Hands,</hi> nor their <hi>Heads</hi> that can be at all Acceptable unto God. That which pleaſes God muſt come from God. what he <hi>Appoints</hi> he <hi>Approves,</hi> and nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. <hi>Will Worſhip,</hi> and Mixtures of Mens Inventions with Gods Pure Ordinances, are the great Canons that batter Cities, and the Gun-Powder that blows them up. Thoſe bring the Lord of Hoſts to War againſt them. It was the Calves that wounded <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and laid their Cities waſte. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But however, he might mince the Matter, as others do in like Circumſtances; yet God being a Jealous God, would not admit ſuch Innovation, and Varying from his pure Worſhip, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects it. And in particular, he is Rebuked, <hi>For Offering upon the Altar which he had made in Bethel the</hi> 15th. <hi>day of the</hi> 8th. <hi>month; even in the Month which he had deviſed of his own Heart.</hi> 1 Kings 12. 33. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 5, 6. <hi>Becauſe they have tranſgreſſed the Laws, and changed the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, therefore hath the Curſe devoured the Earth, and they that dwell therein are deſolate; therefore the Inhabitants of the Earth are burned and few Men left.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly. <hi>Will Worſhip Grieves God.</hi> Ezek. 6. 9. <hi>I am broken with their Whoriſh Heart.</hi> Their Superſtitious and Corrupt Mixtures did not ſimply <hi>diſpleaſe</hi> God; but <hi>Oppreſſed, Afflicted,</hi> and <hi>Broke</hi> his Heart. Great Injuries enter deep, and eat up the Spirits of any they are done unto. And what greater wrong can be done unto God, than to Invent and Impoſe that he never commanded in the Matters of his Worſhip? Yea it draws away the Heart of Men from God, and therefore they are ſaid <hi>to go a Whoring from God by their Inventons.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Sixthly. <hi>Will Worſhip</hi> is that which God will not Honour with his preſence. Neither Chriſt nor the Angels will be preſent at it. <hi>Teach them</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>to Obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you, and lo I am with you alway.</hi> If we ſtep out of Chriſt's <hi>way,</hi> and <hi>go a whoring</hi> after our own <hi>Devices;</hi> neither can we groundedly expect the bleſſing of Chriſt's <hi>Preſerce.</hi>

               <p>§ 1. WHereas Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> affirms; that the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9. was a pure Goſpel Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to which the Seal of Circumciſion was annexed. From hence he draws this Inference. <hi>That if that Covenant were a pure Goſpel Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, reaching Gentile Believers, and their Children, as well as</hi> Abraham <hi>and his; then we cannot be denied the External Sign and Seal of the ſame Covenant: For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>though the Outward Signs may be changed; yet there is no Change of the Priviledges, if the Covenant Remain entire. p.</hi> 9, 10.</p>
               <p>§ 2. We Anſwer; <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is no Evidence in all the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of any <hi>Seal</hi> which God intended ſhould be annexed unto the Goſpel Covenant, but that of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> only. Much leſs are we left at Liberty to put what Mark, Sign, or Cognizance, we pleaſe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Infant Seed; under the Notion of an Ordinance of Chriſt, or as a Goſpel Seal, without his Special Direction and Appointment.</p>
               <p>§ 3. <hi>Secondly.</hi> It cannot be denied, but that <hi>Circumciſion</hi> which was at firſt the Sign of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and which was afterward annexed to the Covenant made at <hi>Sinai,</hi> is now Aboliſhed. And it is as plain, that the Covenant, both the one and the other, which Circumciſion was Annexed unto; was a <hi>Bondage Covenant:</hi> For ſo the Apoſtle aſſures us <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 24. So likewiſe <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Stand faſt therefore in the Liberty. wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and be not intangled again with the Yoke of Bondage.

                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:50207:62"/> 
                  <hi>that if ye be Circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing: For I teſtifie again to every Man that is Circumciſed, that he is a debtour to do the whole Law.</hi> Now Circumciſion being Aboliſhed, and the Covenants alſo, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it was Annexed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7. 13. there can be no juſt Inference drawn from the manner of God's dealing with them, to conclude that thus it muſt be now; it being an undue Suppoſition to conceive that the Propoſition between <hi>Abraham</hi> and his <hi>Fleſhly Seed,</hi> in the time when Circumciſion was <hi>in date,</hi> ſhould be the ſame to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Carnal Seed</hi> of every Believer, in that Seaſon, when Circumciſion is <hi>out of date.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Though it is Evident, that the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in Reſpect of the Inward and Spititual part of either, are both the ſame, without any Variation, as is alſo the Covenant of Grace, on which both are founded; yet it doth not therefore follow, that there is no Variation or Change in Reſpect of External Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations: It being Evident, that the External Priviledges the <hi>Jews</hi> once boaſted of are now Repealed; their former Pretentions to Church-Ordinances upon the Account of their <hi>Birth-Priviledge,</hi> being now broken <hi>down.</hi> Elſe, why doth <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> tell them as he doth. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 8, 9. <hi>Think not to ſay within your ſelves, we have Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham to our Father.</hi> They had <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father, as much now as before: But now it was too late for them to uſe that Plea any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: And there was good Reaſon why. <hi>For now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Axe is laid at the Root of the Trees: Every Tree therefore that bringeth not forth good Fruit muſt be hewn down.</hi> Now the <hi>Axe</hi> is laid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It ſeems then that the <hi>Axe</hi> was not laid at the Root of the Trees till now: But now the <hi>Axe</hi> muſt do its Work of that Kind; and ſo muſt the <hi>Goſpel Fan</hi> alſo, at an other-gueſs Rate than formerly they had Experienc'd; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch, as Jeſus Chriſt was now Reſolved <hi>throughly to purge his Floor, and to gather the Wheat,</hi> only <hi>into his Garner</hi> the Church. So that from hence it plainly appears, that though the Church for the inward Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it, is ſtill the ſame that ever it was; yet as the Signs are changed, ſo there is as manifeſt a Change, in Reſpect of the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Priviledges, belonging to the one and the other of them.</p>

               <p>§ 1. MR. <hi>Sidenham</hi> doth indeed tell us; <hi>That the forementioned Scripture,</hi> Mat. 3. 7, 8, 9. <hi>Concerns only the</hi> Adult, <hi>or Men at Age; the</hi> Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>who were degenerated from</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Faith, a</hi> Generation of Vipers: <hi>And therefore rejected by</hi> John <hi>when they Deſired to be Baptized of him.

                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:50207:63"/> 
                  <hi>them</hi> becauſe Abraham was their Father; <hi>or upon that Account that</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's Seed had no Right to the Promiſe; <hi>But only as</hi> pretending Abraham <hi>to be their Father, when they walk'd contrary to the Principles of</hi> Abraham's Faith.</p>
               <p>§ 2. For the clearing of which, there are 3 Queſtions to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> Why doth Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> ſay, that <hi>John</hi> did not <hi>Refuſe</hi> them, becauſe <hi>Abraham was their Father?</hi> Who ever affirmed, that <hi>John</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed <hi>them,</hi> becauſe <hi>Abraham was their Father?</hi> But as <hi>John</hi> did not <hi>Refuſe</hi> them on <hi>that Score;</hi> ſo it is as evident, that neither would he now <hi>Receive</hi> them on <hi>that bottom.</hi> It cannot be denied, but that at the <hi>command</hi> of God, this was the <hi>ground</hi> of their Admiſſion <hi>before,</hi> becauſe <hi>Abraham was their Father;</hi> and this they <hi>ſtill</hi> inſiſted on: But now (ſaith he) <hi>Think not to ſay within your ſelves, we have Abraham to our Father,</hi> &amp;c. whereby he plainly lets them know, that <hi>that Plea</hi> would <hi>no longer</hi> avail them on that Account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Why doth Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> ſay, that <hi>John</hi> did not refuſe them, <hi>upon that Account that Abraham's Seed had no right to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe?</hi> We know of none that ſo affirm: But this we ſay; That as their <hi>Intereſt in the Promiſe,</hi> was not the Adequate, formal, or proper Reaſon of the <hi>Circumciſing</hi> of them; (for <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and others were to be <hi>Circumciſed,</hi> to whom none of the <hi>Promiſes</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant did <hi>belong:</hi> as is plain from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 21, 23. whereby 'tis evident, that the true Reaſon why any were Circumciſed, was the <hi>Command,</hi> not <hi>Intereſt in the Promiſe)</hi> The like we ſay in reſpect of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Why doth Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> ſay, That <hi>John refuſed them,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they only pretended <hi>Abraham</hi> to be their Father? For were they not <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Natural</hi> Off-ſpring now, as much as ever? And was not that the ground of their Admiſſion formerly? We do not ſay, they were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Off-ſpring in a <hi>Spiritual</hi> ſenſe, ſo as to walk in the <hi>ſteps</hi> of their Father <hi>Ahraham:</hi> For that was not the <hi>Ground</hi> of their Admiſſion <hi>formerly;</hi> but the ground of their Admiſſion then, was meerly by vertue of the <hi>Command of God,</hi> as they were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Natural Seed.</hi> The Queſtion between us therefore, is only this; Whether becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Natural</hi> Off-ſpring, barely as ſuch, were by the <hi>Expreſs Command of God,</hi> admitted to <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> Therefore <hi>without the like Command;</hi> ſo muſt <hi>ours</hi> to <hi>Baptiſm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 3. 'Tis true Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> tells us; That <hi>John</hi> rejected the Scribes and Phariſees from Baptiſm: <hi>Becauſe they only pretended</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>to be their Father; when they walk'd contrary to the ſteps of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham<hi>'s Faith.</hi> But then why were not ſuch as theſe rejected <hi>before?</hi> For certain it is, <hi>none</hi> were rejected from <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> how vile, or prophane ſoever. There was then no <hi>Faith</hi> nor <hi>Repentance,</hi> nor <hi>Fruits meet for Repentance,</hi> at all required of any to be admitted into
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50207:63" rendition="simple:additions"/> the <hi>Jewiſh Church;</hi> whether they were <hi>Children,</hi> or Men at <hi>Age;</hi> It was enough in that reſpect, barely to be of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Seed,</hi> or <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;</hi> though only as <hi>Servants born in his Houſe,</hi> or <hi>Strangers bought with Money;</hi> without any other Conſideration. But <hi>now</hi> not ſo. <hi>Now</hi> ſaith <hi>John, You muſt bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance,</hi> if you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be Baptized with the <hi>Baptiſm of Repentance.</hi> For to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he beſpeaks them. <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. <hi>And now alſo,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the Axe laid unto the Root of the Trees; therefore every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewn down.</hi> Plainly intimating, that their <hi>Birth Priviledge</hi> was now to be pulled up by the <hi>Roots;</hi> And God would no longer take it as he had in <hi>Times paſt;</hi> ſince now nothing ſhort of their <hi>Actual Faithfulneſs</hi> in the Paths of Righteouſneſs would ſerve the turn. A clear Argument that the <hi>External</hi> Adminiſtration of the Covenant, or the <hi>Grounds</hi> of Admiſſion to the Priviledge of <hi>External</hi> Church-Memberſhip, are now quite altered, to what they were in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Time.</p>
               <p>§ 4. And indeed, for this very Reaſon is it, that the <hi>Natural</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are to this day rejected and Excluded from any Participation of <hi>Goſpel-Church Ordinanees;</hi> as it is apparent they have been for many Generations; whereby 'tis evident, that the <hi>Birth-Priviledge,</hi> they formerly ſo much inſiſted on, and gloried in, is <hi>now at an end,</hi> and the Date thereof expired. And certain it is, that not only are thoſe at <hi>Age</hi> rejected, but their <hi>Children</hi> alſo upon the ſame <hi>Ground; viz.</hi> for want of that <hi>Actual</hi> Faith and Fruitfulneſs, which the Goſpel now requires. For otherwiſe it cannot be denied, but that both <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> alſo, have as fair a Title to <hi>Abraham</hi> their <hi>Father,</hi> as any of their <hi>Progenitors</hi> ever had: But we ſee this <hi>Birth Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge</hi> of theirs, though it ſtood them inſtead, as to their Admiſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Legal</hi> Church, their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfruitfulneſs</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet it avails them not under this more <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>Refined</hi> Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> But both Parents and Children alſo, are now <hi>broken off,</hi> and have no right upon the <hi>former Terms only,</hi> of ſtanding any longer as <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Viſible</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>§. 5. And clear it is, that even you your ſelves would be apt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to reject an <hi>Infant</hi> begotten of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Parents from <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Baptiſm, until <hi>capable</hi> of making an <hi>Actual Profeſſion</hi> of the Chriſtian Faith. And for the ſame reaſon you ought as well to refuſe thoſe born of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Parents, 'till capable of making the ſame <hi>Profeſſion:</hi> Becauſe in reſpect of <hi>Parentage</hi> or <hi>Natural</hi> Deſcent, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Infants have as <hi>much</hi> to plead as <hi>ours,</hi> and it may be <hi>more;</hi> ſince they are deſcended from <hi>Believing Abraham;</hi> who is called <hi>the Father of the Faithful,</hi> or <hi>the Father of all them that Believe:</hi> Which is more than any beſides can pretend unto.</p>

               <p>§. 1. AS for Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi>'s Argument for Infants Baptiſm from <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 13. 14. We deny not, but do believe that Jeſus Chriſt hath a moſt compaſſionate regard to <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>little Infants;</hi> and it is our duty therefore to <hi>bring them to him,</hi> by Prayer and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for them. But yet notwithſtanding this, we dare not <hi>bring them to ſuch a Goſpel Ordinance as Baptiſm</hi> is, unleſs Chriſt had <hi>expreſly</hi> Appointed, and called <hi>them to it;</hi> or ſignified his Pleaſure that <hi>this Way they ſhould have come unto him.</hi> Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> tells indeed, <hi>That the Reaſon why the Diſciples forbad and rebuked thoſe that brought thoſe Children unto Chriſt. could not be out of any</hi> Cruelty <hi>to Infants, or that they had no Bowels for them, or Affections to them.</hi> But (ſaith he) <hi>It muſt be from ſome ſuch</hi> Principle <hi>which thoſe of a contrary Judgment take up; That they were not</hi> capable, <hi>and were firſt to be</hi> Taught; <hi>That only grown</hi> Men, <hi>and</hi> Profeſſors <hi>of</hi> Faith, <hi>were fit for Ordinances: And therefore</hi> they rebuked <hi>or chod them, and</hi> forbade them <hi>to do ſo any more: As if they had ſaid; What have we to do with</hi> Children <hi>as to</hi> outward <hi>Ordinances? They are not</hi> capable; <hi>they cannot</hi> Profeſs their Faith; <hi>and we muſt have Perſons able to hold</hi> Forth Chriſt's Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>which muſt be the</hi> viſible <hi>Subjects of Chriſt's Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 2. But then Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> contradicts himſelf, and ſpoils all again afterward; when he tells us, <q>That whereas Chriſt took up thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in his Arms, and laid his Hands upon them; it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, but in one of theſe 3 Senſes; either <hi>Firſt,</hi> in order to the <hi>Cure</hi> of Diſeaſes by a Miraculous Power. <hi>Secondly,</hi> for <hi>Conſecration</hi> of any to any Divine Work and Service; or <hi>Thirdly,</hi> for <hi>Confirmation after Baptiſm.</hi> And to this purpoſe (ſaith he) may we apply Chriſt's Act to theſe Infants, to <hi>confirm</hi> the Promiſe ſolemnly after <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> For (ſaith he) It was moſt generally uſed after <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth baptiſm to <hi>Precede.</hi> And (ſaith he) Let any that differ from us, ſhew any where in the Goſpel, when Chriſt <hi>laid his Hands</hi> upon any Perſon, in this latter Senſe, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbaptized.</hi> Wherein he</q> doth expreſly take it for granted, or at leaſt he doth ſtrongly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that theſe Infants had been already <hi>Baptized;</hi> and that this <hi>Act</hi> of Chriſt, was for their <hi>Confirmation after Baptiſm.</hi> Now if thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants had been <hi>already Baptized,</hi> it muſt have been Adminiſtred to them, either by <hi>Chriſt himſelf,</hi> or his <hi>Diſciples;</hi> Not by <hi>Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> who as Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> grants, <hi>Baptized no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e.</hi> And if they had been already <hi>Baptized</hi> by the <hi>Diſciples,</hi> (which muſt be by vertue of ſome <hi>Special Order,</hi> or <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from Chriſt) Then how doth this agree with what Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> had ſaid before? When he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 91. <q>That the reaſon why the Diſciples <hi>forbad</hi> and <hi>rebuked</hi> thoſe that brought theſe Children unto Chriſt, muſt needs be from ſome
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50207:64"/> ſuch <hi>Principle</hi> which thoſe of a contrary Judgment take up; that they were not <hi>capable,</hi> and were firſt to be <hi>Taught;</hi> that only <hi>grown Men,</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors of Faith</hi> were fit for Ordinances.</q> For if they had been <hi>already Baptized</hi> upon Chriſt's <hi>ſpecial Order</hi> to that purpoſe to them; (which muſt be ſuppoſed if they had been Baptized at all) there had been then no <hi>room</hi> for ſuch Scruples as theſe; Neither is it any way <hi>likely,</hi> that they would have at all <hi>Rebuked</hi> thoſe that brought them; but rather have <hi>encouraged</hi> them ſo to do, and have been <hi>helpful</hi> themſelves to have <hi>Introduced</hi> them into Chriſt's Preſence, in order to the obtaining his <hi>Benediction</hi> on them, <hi>after the Adminiſtration</hi> of ſo Solemn an Ordinance.</p>
               <p>§. 3. So that this doth clearly demonſtrate to us, That at leaſt, theſe little Children were not <hi>then</hi> Baptized; nor indeed can <hi>this</hi> Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture be intended <hi>at all</hi> as a <hi>Rule</hi> unto us to that purpoſe: where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is at all <hi>mentioned,</hi> or can at all rationally be <hi>Suppoſed</hi> to have been <hi>Practiſed,</hi> either by <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his <hi>Diſciples</hi> upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. That they had not been Baptized by <hi>Chriſt himſelf,</hi> is evident from the very Letter of the Text; He <hi>Himſelf Baptizing not:</hi> And that they had not been Baptized by the <hi>Diſciples</hi> is alſo as plain: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they had not expreſs'd the <hi>unwillingneſs</hi> they did that <hi>ſuch ſhould be brought unto Chriſt</hi> for their <hi>Confirmation after Baptiſm;</hi> which as we ſee Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> doth ſo ungroundedly ſuppoſe had been <hi>already</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred unto them. Let us then bring our Infants to Chriſt in the way that <hi>himſelf</hi> hath appointed: But let us not of our <hi>own Heads</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter ſuch an Ordinance as <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to them, without his ſpecial <hi>Warrant;</hi> leſt we incur the guilt of <hi>Will Worſhip;</hi> and leſt he ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us at leaò, as he did unto the Jews upon another Account; <hi>Who hath required theſe things at your Hands?</hi>
               </p>

               <p>§. 4.

               <p>§. 1. MR. <hi>Sidenham</hi> Arguing from the Inſtitution. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. tells us, p. 128, 129, 130. <hi>That if that place be the Prime Inſtitution of Baptizing (from which place, we Exclude Infants, where Chriſt uſeth ſuch univerſal and Comprehenſive Expreſſions) We ſhall deſire (ſaith he) but to deal with them on their ground, and the ſame Text will Serve to prove our Poſitions, more demonſtratively than theirs. And this Text (ſaith he) ſhews that Chriſt gave Commiſſion to the Apoſtles and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> to Preach and Baptize, <hi>but in what</hi> order <hi>to do it; or what ſhould be required, or the qualification of the</hi> Subject, <hi>as abſolutely Neceſſary, is not at all diſcovered in this Scripture. They muſt look for another Text to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude</hi> Infants, <hi>beſides this; Ele give up their Confidence. Either (ſaith he) this place is the full and Exact Rule, or Inſtitution of</hi> Baptizing <hi>or it is not: If they ſay it is; then it would diſcribe the Perſons and the maner; The matter and the</hi> form <hi>of Baptizing, and that in the uſuall Phraſe with other Scriptures: But here is only a</hi> General Commiſſion <hi>to two great Acts, viz. To</hi> Preach, Teach and Baptize. <hi>And we may ſay in the ſame place; That whoever are</hi> outwardly Taught, <hi>or do but</hi> hear <hi>the Goſpel (though they</hi> walk <hi>never ſo contrary) muſt be Baptized: For the Commiſſion is,</hi> Teach and Baptize. <hi>Nothing of the Parties</hi> Entertainment of it <hi>is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this</hi> 28 Mat. <hi>nor of the</hi> qualification of the Subject, <hi>with any diſtinguiſhing Character. If they ſay, This doth not hold forth all the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions in every particular (as they muſt grant) then we may compare</hi> other <hi>Scriptures with this, to make out the</hi> full <hi>Inſtitution; as theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>§. To this we Reply; That notwithſtanding all the Confidence which Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> here expreſſeth; both the <hi>Qualification</hi> of the Subjects of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as alſo the <hi>manner</hi> or <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Baptizing,</hi> are <hi>ſufficiently</hi> ſet forth unto us in the preſent <hi>Inſtitution:</hi> For;</p>
               <p>Firſt, If we enquire after the <hi>Subject;</hi> It is plain by this Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that none are to be Baptized, but ſuch as are <hi>Taught,</hi> ſo as to be <hi>Diſcipled</hi> into the true <hi>Faith and Profeſſion</hi> of Chriſtianity. <hi>Go Teach all Nations, Baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Infants</hi> being <hi>uncapable</hi> of being thus <hi>Taught,</hi> or <hi>Diſciped;</hi> they are therefore Excluded: But all others that ſo hear the Goſpel, as to underſtand it, Believe it, and be Diſcipled by it, are according to this Commiſſion to be Baptized. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> tells us, <q>That whoſoever are outwardly <hi>Taught,</hi> or do but <hi>hear</hi> the Goſpel (though they walk never ſo <hi>contrary)</hi> muſt be <hi>Baptized,</hi> inaſmuch as in the <hi>Commiſſion. Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>nothing</hi> of the Parties <hi>entertainment of it</hi> is there mentioned.</q> With what ſhadow of Truth could Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> utter ſuch a Sentence? When he could not but know; that as according to that very Inſtitution, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. Such as are <hi>Diſcipled</hi> by the Preaching of the Goſpel are there appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Baptized. <hi>Go Teach all Nations,</hi> &amp;c. That is, as your ſelves have acknowledged, <hi>Diſciple all Nations, Baptizing them.</hi> So in that parallel place. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 16. (which is but a rehearſal of the ſame Commiſſion by another of the Holy Pen Men) our Saviour there tells us; <hi>He that Believeth and is Baptized ſhall be Saved.</hi> Plainly ſhewing, that thoſe that are to be Baptized muſt be ſuch, <hi>as ſo hear the Goſpel,</hi> as to give a <hi>Believing entertainment to it.</hi> He had ſaid before, <hi>Go Preach the Goſpel to every Greature,</hi> And then it immediately follows, <hi>He that Believeth and is Baptized ſhall be Saved.</hi> And if here be not a plain notice given of the <hi>qualification</hi> of ſuch as are to be admitted to <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm;</hi> Let ſuch Judge whoſe Eyes are open.</p>
               <p>Secondly; if we enquire after the <hi>manner</hi> or <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Baptizing,</hi> the very <hi>Word</hi> it ſelf is plainly ſignificant of Chriſt's Mind and Meaning therein. <hi>Go Teach all Nations, Baptizing them;</hi> that is, let them be <hi>dipt or plunged under Water;</hi> which is the <hi>native Senſe</hi> and <hi>ſignification</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> Word, which we Tranſlate <hi>Baptize,</hi> as hath been already proved. So that whatever Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> tells us; the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> which Chriſt gave to his Apoſtles concerning <hi>Baptiſm</hi> doth afford <hi>ſufficient Direction,</hi> both in reſpect of the <hi>qualification</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> as alſo in reference to the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>§. 3. As for the reſt of the Arguments made uſe of by Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> for the ſupport of Infants Baptiſm, from the <hi>Nature of the Covenant made with Abraham,</hi> from <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39.

Only there are two Arguments in Mr. <hi>Allen's</hi> Treatiſe before mentioned, which were then omitted; but muſt now be Anſwered.</p>

               <p>§. 1. THE firſt hath Referrence to thoſe ſeveral Titles of a <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>peculiar People,</hi> which are frequently in the Scripture given to the whole Body of the <hi>Jewiſh Nation, Church</hi> and <hi>People;</hi> from whence he infers, that there is no ſuch difference as we affirm there is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> Churches. For (ſaith he) <q>If thoſe <hi>terms</hi> are frequently given in the Epiſtles to Church Members <hi>now,</hi> the ſame <hi>Epethites</hi> are frequently given to the Members of the <hi>Jewiſh Church.</hi> And therefore there is no ſuch <hi>Difference</hi> as is Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of either of them, they being both alike <hi>Spiritual.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. To this we Anſwer; Firſt, If there be no <hi>difference</hi> between the Old and New Teſtament Churches, in reſpect of the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of either of them; but that there was the ſame <hi>Purity, Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality,</hi> in the one, as in the other; Then what needed, or wherein conſiſted that <hi>Reformation,</hi> which the Apoſtle tells us was to take place in the <hi>Goſpel day.</hi> Heb. 9. 8, 9, 10. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt this ſignifying, that the way into the Holieſt of all was not yet made manifeſt, while as the firſt Tabernacle was yet ſtanding; which was a Figure for the time then preſent: In which were offered both Gifts and Sacrifices that could not make him that did the Service perfect; as pertaining to the Conſcience; which ſtood only in Meats and Drinks, and divers Waſhings, and Carnal Ordinances, Impoſed on them until the time of Reformation.</hi> Plainly Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating that there were many things <hi>faulty</hi> among them, and many things <hi>defective</hi> alſo, which were to be <hi>Reformed, Rectified,</hi> and <hi>Supplied,</hi> when the Day-light of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was to <hi>break</hi> upon them. And upon this account, not only doth the Spirit of God <hi>find fault</hi> with the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant it ſelf</hi> which they were then under, which therefore was now to be <hi>done away,</hi> and a <hi>new One</hi> to take place. Heb. 8. 7, 8, 13. But for this Reaſon alſo was the <hi>Seed to be changed.</hi> The <hi>Carnal</hi> Seed being <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,</hi> and only the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> admitted as Members of the Gopſel Church. A plain notice of which Change is given by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, the Harbinger of the Goſpel Diſpenſation. Mat. 3. 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Think not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to ſay within your ſelves, we have</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>to our Father; For I ſay unto you, that GOD is able even of theſe Stones to raiſe up Children unto</hi> Abraham. <hi>And now alſo the Axe is laid unto the Root of the Trees; therefore every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewn down.</hi> Plainly requiring a <hi>perſonal</hi> and <hi>actual Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:50207:66" rendition="simple:additions"/> in all the Members of this <hi>new Church ſtate;</hi> which is excluſive not only of all thoſe that are ſuch as the Phariſees and Sadduces were, whom he was now ſpeaking to, who were a <hi>Generation of Vipers,</hi> and were actually debauch'd in their Converſations; but of all ſuch alſo, as were either <hi>neglective,</hi> or are uncapable (as is the Caſe of <hi>Infants)</hi> of <hi>actual</hi> Fruitfulneſs in the Paths of Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>§. 3. So that when you tell us that the Legal and Goſpel Church are alike Spiritual: We ſay not; For it is plain there was no ſuch <hi>Inquiſition</hi> concerning the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> qualities, the Fruitfulneſs, or Unfruitfulneſs of the Members of the former Church, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> thereinto. It was enough barely to be of <hi>Abraham's Seed</hi> or <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi> to be ſo eſteemed: But <hi>now</hi> ſaith <hi>John, the Axe is laid unto the Root of the Trees;</hi> And they muſt all be <hi>hewn down</hi> under the Goſpel, that have nothing elſe to pretend unto but that of a <hi>Godly Parentage;</hi> which plainly excludes <hi>Infants,</hi> as well as all other unfruitful Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from the Goſpel Church. And to this ſame purpoſe is it that he doth further aſſure them: ver. 12. That Jeſus Chriſt was now reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Goſpel <hi>Fan to Purge thoroghly the Floor</hi> of the Goſpel Church; and to <hi>gather the Wheat into His Garner.</hi> Under the Law, and before alſo, even in <hi>Abrahmam</hi>'s time, the <hi>Chaff</hi> and the <hi>Wheat</hi> remained together unſevered; but now the <hi>Fan</hi> muſt go to Work. We read of no ſuch Fanning <hi>Work</hi> in the <hi>former</hi> Church ſtate. And to what purpoſe is it elſe that Chriſt told the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> as he doth. <hi>Jo.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>The Hour cometh, and now is, when the true Worſhippers ſhall Worſhip the Father in Spirit and in Truth: For the Father ſeeketh ſuch to Worſhip Him?</hi> Which plainly ſheweth that God expecteth now greater Purity, Exactneſs, and Spirituality, in ſuch as were to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach His Preſence in the Celebration of <hi>Goſpel Worſhip.</hi> And indeed of this the whole fifth of <hi>Mat.</hi> is a ſufficient and convincing Proof, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clear evidence concerning the <hi>refinedneſs</hi> and <hi>ſpirituality</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Adminiſtration above and beyond that of the <hi>Law.</hi> For then (ſaith our Saviour) it was thus and thus; but I am come to tell you a <hi>New</hi> Doctrine, and do call you up to greater <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Strictneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 4. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We Anſwer, That that <hi>Holineſs</hi> which was aſcribed unto the whole Body of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, was a <hi>Typical, Ceremonial Holineſs;</hi> and was no other than was aſcribed to the whole <hi>Land, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Temple, Altar,</hi> and divers other things, and is therefore now <hi>Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed</hi> For if all things under the Law were but a <hi>Figure and Shadow of good things to come,</hi> then ſuch was the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of the Jewiſh <hi>Nation</hi> and <hi>People</hi> alſo. Now this the Apoſtle in the 9th and 10th Chapters to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> proves at large, ſhewing that all things under the <hi>Law;</hi> all the Priviledges of the <hi>Old Covenànt,</hi> with all the Perquiſites, Dependancies, and Appurtenances thereunto belonging; are called by ſuch Names, as make them evidently appear to be <hi>Typical.</hi> As
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50207:67"/> Firſt, they are called a <hi>Figure.</hi> Heb. 9. 9. <hi>Which was a Figure for the time then preſent.</hi> So verſe 24. <hi>For Chriſt is not Entered into the Holy Place made with Hands, which are the Figures of the true.</hi> Secondly, They are called a <hi>Pattern.</hi> Heb. 9. 23. <hi>It was neceſſary that the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of things in the Heavens,</hi> &amp;c. Thirdly, They are called a <hi>Shadow.</hi> Heb. 10. 1. <hi>For the</hi> Law <hi>having a Shadow of good things to come, and not the very Image of the thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> &amp;c. Now the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of the Jewiſh <hi>Nation</hi> being an <hi>Appurtenance</hi> belonging to the Law, or the Old Covenant. It was but a <hi>Figure, Pattern,</hi> or <hi>Shadow of all good things to come,</hi> and was therefore <hi>Typical,</hi> and is now <hi>Aboliſhed.</hi> And if we will know what the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of the Jewiſh Nation did ſerve, to <hi>Typifie</hi> or Repreſent unto us; It is evident, that as it <hi>Typified the Holineſs of Chriſt himſelf;</hi> So of all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Spiritual Seed, who are made <hi>Holy</hi> by <hi>Believing</hi> in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§ 5. The Time of <hi>Reformation</hi> therefore, ſpoken of in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Scripture. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 8, 9, 10. <hi>being come;</hi> wherein thoſe Imperfect Gifts and Sacrifices, with all thoſe <hi>Carnal</hi> Ordinances which were for a Seaſon <hi>Impoſed</hi> on the Jewiſh Nation, were to be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and the Goſpel-Church taking place in the <hi>Room thereof:</hi> It cannot rationally be ſuppoſed, but the one doth far exceed the other, at leaſt, in <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Inward Glory:</hi> For by how much Chriſt hath now obtained <hi>a more excellent Miniſtry</hi> than that of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and by how much alſo <hi>he is the Mediatour of a better Covenant, Which is Eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes;</hi> as the Apoſtle affirmes. Heb. 8. 6. By ſo much of neceſſity muſt the <hi>goſpell</hi> Church exceed in <hi>luſtre, beauty, Refinedneſs</hi> and <hi>Spirituality,</hi> the <hi>former</hi> Adminiſtration.</p>

               <p>THE Second Argument in Mr. <hi>Allen</hi>'s Book, remaining to be Anſwered, is this; <q>That all Perſons, and ſo little Children, that were of the Legal Church, muſt needs, in one Reſpect or other, have been Perſons of a <hi>Religious,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual</hi> Conſideration. And this conſidered (ſaith he) I know not upon what better to place the <hi>Viſible</hi> Church-Memberſhip of <hi>Infants;</hi> or to Attribute it to, than God's <hi>Electing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and <hi>Calling them to his People,</hi> and their Parents <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating</hi> and <hi>Devoting</hi> them to God, and his Service. And the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture uſeth to reckon little Children, as having begun to do this or that, when they are but placed in Circumſtances, that will bring them to it <hi>Actually</hi> in the <hi>Iſſue.</hi> And thus <hi>the Children of the</hi> Koha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites, <hi>of a Month Old, were numbred with their Fathers, as with them keeping the charge of the Sanctuary,</hi> when they were but in a way of being trained up to it.

               </p>
               <p>§ 2. To this we Anſwer; <hi>Firſt,</hi> By granting that it was in a <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:50207:67"/> Conſideration, that <hi>Children</hi> were then <hi>Admitted</hi> Members of the <hi>Legal</hi> Church: But yet it doth not therefore follow, that they are to be <hi>admitted</hi> Members of the Goſpel-Church; for the Reaſons before rendered: The <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Admiſſion</hi> into <hi>that,</hi> being far more <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> than were <hi>thoſe</hi> under the <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas he tells us, That the Reaſon of their <hi>Admiſſion</hi> into the <hi>Legal</hi> Church; was God's <hi>Electing,</hi> and <hi>Calling them to that Priviledge.</hi> This we alſo grant: But then we alſo ſay, that though the <hi>Call</hi> and <hi>Election of God,</hi> in Reference to the <hi>Inward Subſtance</hi> of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> or to an <hi>Inviſible</hi> Memberſhip in the <hi>Inviſible</hi> Church, is <hi>Invariable;</hi> It doth not follow, that the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Callings of God</hi> in Reference to <hi>External</hi> Memberſhip, are therefore alſo <hi>Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable</hi> or <hi>Irrevokable;</hi> (as is afterward by Mr. <hi>Allen Aſſerted;</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which we have already in the Second Part of this Diſcourſe given a ſufficient Anſwer.) For we find by undeniable Evidence; that thoſe <hi>External</hi> Gifts and Priviledges that the <hi>Natural</hi> Poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> were once <hi>Inveſted</hi> with, are now <hi>Reſcinded, Repealed,</hi> and <hi>Repented of;</hi> and it cannot be affirmed, that in any <hi>Religious</hi> Capacity whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they are now at all owned by God, as his Church and People, as once they were, neither Parents nor Children: But for the moſt part remain broken off, and Unchurched to this Day. And if you ſay, That <hi>they and their Children being broken off, We and our Children are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed in their Room;</hi> This is that which remains to be proved; and indeed the contrary is manifeſt, as hath been already with abundant Evidence Demonſtrated, in the foregoing Parts of this Diſcourſe; ſince the Axe of the Goſpel is <hi>now laid unto the Root of the Trees; and every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewn down,</hi> in reſpect of any further Church Priviledge, which before was Indulged unto them: which clearly cuts off the pretence of <hi>Children</hi> unto any ſuch Priviledge under the Goſpel, as well as all other <hi>

To this we Anſwer; That it is indeed a very Pious and Commendable thing, for Parents to <hi>Dedicate</hi> and Devote their Children to God, and his Service; and to this Purpoſe, to train them up, as ſoon as they are capable <hi>in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</hi> But it doth not therefore follow, that they can juſtly be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>Church-Members</hi> now, till <hi>Converted,</hi> and <hi>wrought upon</hi> by the Preaching of the Goſpel unto them, whatever they were under the Law, as hath been before demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>§ 3. And though the <hi>Kohathites</hi> of a Month Old were numbred
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50207:68" rendition="simple:additions"/> with their Fathers, <hi>as keeping the charge of the Sanctuary;</hi> Evident it is, that this was the proper Work of the <hi>Kohathites,</hi> by God's ſpecial Direction in their ſeveral <hi>Generations;</hi> and as they became to grow up to the <hi>Competency</hi> of Years, an <hi>Actual</hi> diſcharge of that Duty was required of them; This being an <hi>External</hi> Service, which by God's ſpecial Direction, was <hi>peculiarly</hi> Incumbent on all that were of that <hi>Lineage:</hi> But what ſignifies this, to prove the Church-Memberſhip of <hi>Infants</hi> under the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>§ 4. And as little ſignifies that which follows, when he tells us, That for the ſame Reaſon, <hi>little Children were ſaid to enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, when their Parents did ſo,</hi> Deut. 29. 11, 12. For though 'tis true, <hi>thus</hi> it was under the <hi>Law;</hi> yet this proves not the Point in diſpute: For as we have already ſaid; That Covenant which God made with his People <hi>when he took them by the Hand to lead them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>becauſe of the Faultineſs of it, is now Aboliſhed. That Covenant,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>they brake, they continued not it, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded them not.</hi> So that though <hi>Infants</hi> were <hi>Viſible Members</hi> of the <hi>Legal</hi> Church; yet that was by a <hi>Poſitive Law,</hi> and that which is now <hi>Aboliſhed.</hi> Shew us the like now, or you ſay nothing.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Baxter</hi> indeed tells us in his Book, called, <hi>Plain Scripture Proof of Infants Church-Memberſhip and Baptiſm,</hi> p. 57, 58. That the Covenant mentioned in the fore-cited Text, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 12. Where Children are Repreſented as Fellow-Covenanters with their Parents, was a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> or a <hi>Goſpel-Covenant;</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neither it, nor the Church-Memberſhip of Infants, (which, ſaith he, was built thereon, or inſeparably Conjunct) is repealed. For thus runs his Argument. <q>[My 12th Argument (ſaith he) is from the forementioned Text, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 12. where all the Jews with all their little ones, were entred into Covenant with God: From whence I argue thus; if the Covenant which thoſe Infants who were then Church-Members, were entred into with God, was a <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> (or a <hi>Goſpel-Covenant,)</hi> then it is not Repealed, (and conſequently their Churchs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Memberſhip is not Repealed, as being built on the Covenant, or inſeparably Conjunct.) But the ſaid Covenant which the Infants who were then Church-Members did paſs into, was a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> (as diſtinct from the <hi>Law</hi> which is Repealed.) Where by the way, it may be obſerved, that though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> affirms the Covenant mentioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. to be a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> or a <hi>Goſpel-Covenant,</hi> yet he doth here ſeem plainly to grant, that the Law, or <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, was no other than a <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> and accordingly now Repealed.

               </p>
               <p>So that if we can ſubſtantially prove, that the Covenant mentioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 12. was not a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> nor a <hi>Goſpel-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>;</hi> but a legal Covenant, and that which is now Repealed; from hence it will unavoidably follow, and that according to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own Conceſſion, that the Church-Memberſhip of Infants (which as himſelf affirms, was built thereon, or inſeparably Conjunct) is alſo Repealed with it.</p>
               <p>§ 3. Now that the Covenant there mentioned (though there was Grace in it, as there was in all the Covenants that God ever made with Men) is not a Covenant of Grace, properly ſo called, whereof Chriſt is the Mediatour; nor a Goſpel, but a Legal Covenant; is Evident; foraſmuch as it is no other than a Repetition, or Renewal of the Covenant made with that People in <hi>Horeb,</hi> or at Mount <hi>Sinai; when God took them by the Hand to lead them out of</hi> Egypt; which was firſt mentioned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. and that in the very Words and Terms as it is there Expreſſed: That Covenant being now again ſolemnly Repeated, and afreſh Tranſacted between God and them, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. as is manifeſt by comparing <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 4, 5. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. from the 1ſt to the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Verſe.</hi> As alſo, the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſes of that Chapter. And accordingly, whereas in the firſt verſe of this 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Deut.</hi> We are there told, <hi>Theſe are the Words of the Covenant, which the Lord commanded</hi> Moſes <hi>to make with the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>in the Land of</hi> Moab, <hi>beſide the Covenant which he made with them in</hi> Horeb. Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> in his Annotations upon this Text, paraphraſeth the words thus: <q>Theſe are the Terms or Conditions, upon which God hath made, that is, renewed Covenant with you.</q> The Covenant (ſaith he) was but one in Subſtance, but various in the time and manner of its Adminiſtration: And indeed as it is Evident that it is the ſame Covenant for Subſtance, that was firſt made with them in <hi>Horeb:</hi> So it is as Evident from the words themſelves in this forecited text. <hi>Deut-</hi> 29. 1. That it was not a Covenant of Grace; properly ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; but a Covenant of Works, or a Legal Covenant, which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in the Land of <hi>Moab;</hi> ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Mediator of it; In which reſpect, we are there expreſly told, that <hi>theſe are the words of the Covenant which the Lord commanded</hi> Moſes <hi>to make with the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>beſide the Covenant he made with them in</hi> Horeb. Whereas the Covenant of Grace, properly ſo called, hath no other Mediator than Chriſt himſelf. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 5. Who is therefore ſaid to have Obtained <hi>a more Excellent Miniſtry,</hi> viz. <hi>than that of</hi> Moſes; <hi>by how much alſo he is the Mediator of a better Covenant, which is eſtabliſhed</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:50207:69" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>upon better Promiſes.</hi> Heb. 8. 6. <hi>Beſides, we are expreſly told.</hi> Jo. 1. 17. That <hi>the Law was given by</hi> Moſes; <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> From whence; it plainly follows, that the Covenant inſiſted on, was not a Covenant of Grace, properly ſo called, not only for as much as <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Mediator of it; But alſo foraſmuch as the grace and truth which came by Jeſus Chriſt, is here ſo plainly Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed, or oppoſed thereunto.</p>
               <p>§ 4. But that this Covenant, which by the Mediation of <hi>Moſes</hi> was thus Solemnly renewed and afreſh tranſacted between God and them, in the land of <hi>Moab;</hi> was plainly a Covenant of Works, or a Legal Covenant; will be yet further undeniable, by comparing <hi>Exod.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, 5. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 9. and both with Lev. 18. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5. For as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19 (Where that Covenant is firſt mentioned which God made with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the Mediation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Horeb,</hi> or at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. when God took them by the hand to lead them out of <hi>Aegypt)</hi> He there tells them ver. 5. <hi>Now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my Covenant, then ye ſhall be a peculiar treaſure unto me, above all People: for all the Earth is mine.</hi> So in like mannner, upon the ſame terms, and by the hand of the ſame Mediator, is the ſame Covenant afterward renewed with them. Deut. 29. 9. <hi>Keep therefore</hi> (ſaith God there unto them) <hi>the words of this Covenant, and do them, that you may proſper in all that you do.</hi> Now that both theſe were but two ſeveral Repetitions of the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, the Apoſtle plainly ſhews. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. 5. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he there) <hi>is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth: For</hi> Moſes <hi>deſcribeth the Righteouſneſs of the Law, that the man which doth theſe things ſhall live by them,</hi> which he citeth from <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. Where the Lord tells them, <hi>you ſhall therefore keep my Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and Judgments, which if a man do he ſhall live in them.</hi> The ſame with <hi>Exod</hi> 19. 5. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 9. And the ſame Apoſtle alſo aſſures us. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. that <hi>as many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curſe; for it is written</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are in the Book of the Law, to do them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 5. Now it having been thus proved that the Covenants Mentioned in both theſe forenamed Scriptures, were made by the hands of the ſame Mediator <hi>Moſes;</hi> And that they were both alſo of one and the ſame tenor, requiring <hi>perfect Obedience</hi> as the <hi>Condition</hi> of Obtaining the Promiſed Mercy; And foraſmuch as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſo plainly aſſure us, that this was no other than a Covenant of <hi>Works,</hi> and that which he Contradiſtinguiſheth or oppoſeth to the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> or the Goſpel Covenant, which he afterward ſpeaks of <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9. of the ſame <hi>10th</hi> to the <hi>Romans.</hi> From hence it plainly follows, That the formentioned Covenants, both that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. as well as that in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. (which were but two ſeveral Repetitions of the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works;) are now Repealed, and done away in Chriſt:
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50207:69"/> For ſo he doth plainly aſſure us. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8, 9, 13. where he tells us; That <hi>if that firſt Covenant had been faultleſs, then no place ſhould have been ſought for the ſecond: For finding Fault with them, he ſaith, Behold the days come ſaith the Lord, when I will make a New Covenant with the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the Houſe of</hi> Judah; <hi>not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers, in the Day when I took them by the Hand, to lead them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>becauſe they continued not in my Covenant, and I regarded them not.</hi> And verſe 13: <hi>In that he ſaith, a New Covenant he hath made the firſt Old. Now that which decayeth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and waxeth old is ready to vaniſh away.</hi> From whence it is plain that the old Covenant he there ſpeaks of, which God made with his People when he took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5. and <hi>Deut</hi> 29. 9. for the faultyneſs thereof is now Abolliſhed: <hi>For there is verily</hi> (ſaith he) Heb. 7. 18. <hi>a diſannulling of the Commandment going before, for the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unprofitableneſs thereof.</hi> Upon which Account a New Covenant was to take place, which was to be Eſtabliſhed upon <hi>better Promiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 6. And therefore though 'tis true, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. (which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> urgeth, and alledgeth to prove, that the Covenant mentioned Chapter 29. is a Goſpel-Covenant) The Lord then promiſeth that <hi>he will Circumciſe their Heart, and the Heart of their Seed, to love the Lord their God with all their Heart, and with all their Soul, that they might live.</hi> Which are plainly Goſpel Promiſes, yet it is evident, that that is a diſtinct Covenant from that mentioned Chapter 29. the one being <hi>Conditional,</hi> the other <hi>Abſolute:</hi> And it is as evident, that the Promiſes therein contained, were not to be fulfilled, till after the Lord had turned their threatned Captivity, for their Breach of the Covenant he now made with them; and till after he had return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and gathered them from <hi>all the Nations,</hi> and from <hi>the outmoſt Parts of Heaven, whether they ſhould be ſcattered;</hi> and from whence the Lord there promiſeth to gather, and to fetch them, as it is plainly Expreſſed in the 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5th Verſes of that Chapter, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the 24th and 25th Verſes of the 29th Chapter, which was never yet fulfilled.</p>
               <p>§ 7. But ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> [Did God Promiſe Spiritual Grace to the Jews after the Captivity and not before? Was not the Promiſe made to them that then were? Were not they Captivated oft in the time of the Judges, and ſo might at leaſt be made good then? If God would do as much for them before they forſook him, and broke the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by Rebellion, as he would do afterward when they Repented; then he would Circumciſe their Hearts before as well as after: But the former is true, therefore the latter. Beſides, ſome Divines ſay that the Promiſe. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. is Conditional: And if it be on Condition of Obedience, than it was made to more than the Elect; and if it were
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50207:70" rendition="simple:additions"/> not performed to any but the Elect; no wonder, when it was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Promiſe, and the reſt performed not the Condition, which God will Cauſe the Elect to perform.]</p>
               <p>§8. To this we Reply; That as it is evident that the Promiſes mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. are <hi>Abſolute,</hi> and therefore Eſſentially different from thoſe mentioned <hi>ch.</hi> 29. which were <hi>Conditional;</hi> ſo they are as clearly to be underſtood in Reference to <hi>a time to come;</hi> and cannot without palpable ſtreining be applied unto the <hi>time then preſent;</hi> nor indeed unto any time ſince, unto this very day. For thus run the Words, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 1. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, when all theſe things are come upon thee, the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and the Curſe, which I have ſet before thee, and thou ſhalt call them to mind among all the Nations whither the Lord thy God hath driven thee?</hi> ver. 2. <hi>And ſhalt return unto the Lord thy God, and ſhalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy Children, with all thine Heart, and with all thy Soul.</hi> ver. 3. <hi>That then the Lord thy God will turn thy Captivity, and have Compaſſion upon thee, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and gather thee from all the Nations whether the Lord thy God hath ſcattered thee,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>If any of thine be driven out unto the outmoſt parts of Heaven; from thence will the Lord thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee.</hi> ver. 5. <hi>And the Lord thy God will bring thee into the Land which thy Fathers poſſeſſed, and thou ſhalt poſſeſs it, and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy Fathers.</hi> ver. 6. <hi>And the Lord thy God will Circumciſe thine Heart, and the Heart of thy Seed, to Love the Lord thy God with all thine Heart, and with all thy Soul, that thou mayeſt Live.</hi> ver. 7. <hi>And the Lord thy God will put all theſe Curſes upon thine Enemies, and on them that hate thee.</hi> ver 8. <hi>And thou ſhalt return, and obey the voice of the Lord, and do all his Commandments which I command thee this day.</hi> ver. 9. <hi>And the Lord thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine Hand, in the fruit of thy Body, and in the fruit of thy Cattle, and in the fruit of thy Land for good: For the Lord will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy Fathers.</hi> ver. 10. <hi>Becauſe thou ſhalt obey the voice of the Lord thy God in keeping his Commandments, and his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which are written in the Book of this Law, when thou ſhalt return unto the Lord thy God, with all thine Heart, and with all thy Soul.</hi> For thus run the Words of this <hi>10th. verſe.</hi> according to the Old Tranſlation, though they are rendred otherwiſe in the New.</p>

               <p> § 11. We muſt in the next place take notice of the Time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the fulfilling of theſe Goſpel Promiſes unto them. And that was not the time then preſent, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have it: For (ſaith <hi>Moſes, Deut</hi> 29. 4.) <hi>The Lord hath not given you an Heart to perceive and Eyes to ſee, and Ears to hear, unto this day.</hi> Nor in the time of the Judges, or the Prophets that followed after; nor indeed any time that is as yet paſt: But as <hi>Moſes</hi> here tells them; <hi>when all theſe things ſhould have come upon them, the Bleſſing and the Curſe</hi> which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of; which muſt of neceſſity refer to the latter times, or the laſt Age of the World, <hi>when the Lord ſhould turn their Captivity; return and gather them from all the Nations whether they ſhould be ſcattered.</hi> And ſo it is plainly expreſſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 30. <hi>When thou art in Tribulation; and all theſe things are come upon thee, even in the latter days,</hi> &amp;c. For it is plain that <hi>Moſes</hi> aims not at this or that particular Captivity, either in the time of the Judges, before or after, among the <hi>Philiſtines, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> or <hi>Babylonians;</hi> ſince that had been of little Advantage to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from one Captivity, to let them fall into another, and there let them ſtick for ever: But the Words of the Promiſe are of a moſt Comprehenſive Latitude, <hi>viz. If they be driven among all the Nations.</hi> ver. 1. <hi>Or any of them be driven to the outmoſt parts of Heaven.</hi> ver. 4. <hi>The Lord will gather them from all Nations.</hi> ver. 3. <hi>And will fetch them from the outmoſt parts of Heaven.</hi> ver. 4. And it is plain, that as the Promiſe is of a great <hi>Latitude;</hi> ſo of a great <hi>Length</hi> alſo. For this gathering them is promiſed after the <hi>Babilonian</hi> Captivity. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29 1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 10. Nay after Chriſt was come in the Fleſh, it is delivered as a Prophecy. <hi>Jo.</hi> 11. 51. That <hi>Chriſt ſhould gather together into one the Children of God that were ſcattered abroad;</hi> as a thing to be fullfilled in after times.</p>
               <p>§ 12. And in this Reſpect therefore is it that the Prophet <hi>Jer. Ch.</hi> 31. 31, 32, 33. Reciting the ſame Goſpel Covenant ſpoken of in the forementioned 30 <hi>Deut.</hi> Expreſly Repreſents it as a thing future, or as yet then to come, as it had been before ſo repreſented, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their Hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my People. And they ſhall teach no more every Man his Neighbour, and every Man his Brother, ſaying, Know the Lord; for they ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord: For I will forgive their Iniquity, and I will remember their Sins no more.</hi> Where we have the ſame Promiſes for Subſtance with thoſe mentioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. And to the ſame purpoſe the Apoſtle alſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50207:71" rendition="simple:additions"/> it as a thing future, even after the Reſurrection and Aſcention of Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25, 26, 27. <hi>I would not Brethren that ye ſhould be Ignorant of this Myſtery, that Blindneſs in part is happened unto</hi> Iſrael, <hi>until the fulneſs of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>be come in, and ſo all</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved. As it is written; there ſhall come out of</hi> Zion <hi>the Deliverer, and ſhall turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs from</hi> Jacob. <hi>For this is my Covenant unto them, when I ſhall take away their Sins;</hi> wherein, as we may obſerve that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant he here ſpeaks of, is of the ſame Nature with the Promiſes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. as alſo with thoſe before mentioned, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. So we cannot but take notice both there and here, of the Futurity of their Accompliſhment; It being not to be fulfilled <hi>until the Fulneſs of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>be come in. And ſo all</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 13. And 'tis in vain to ſay that theſe Promiſes have already had their Partial and Gradual Accompliſhment: For therein God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not only to <hi>Circumciſe their Heart, but the Heart of their Seed alſo, to Love the Lord their God with all their Heart, and with all their Soul.</hi> Which as it muſt of neceſſity comprehend the whole Body of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Young and Old, of all Sorts, Ages, and Degrees, from the leaſt unto the greateſt, none exempted: So it doth as plainly expreſs a time and ſtate of Perfection; which no particular Perſon, much leſs a whole Generation of God's People, in this World; they and their Off-ſpring alſo, could ever yet truly or juſtly pretend unto. To inſiſt therefore upon a Partial or Gradual Accompliſhment of thoſe Glorious Promiſes; and thence to conclude, that they might be made good or fulfilled in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time; or as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, in the time of the Judges, or the Prophets that followed after; would be no other than to <hi>darken Counſel by Words without Knowledge.</hi> For as <hi>Moſes</hi> doth expreſly aſſure us that thoſe Glorious Promiſes were not fulfilled in his time, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 4. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath not given you an Heart to perceive, and Eyes to ſee, and Ears to hear unto this day;</hi> and as the Prophet <hi>Jer.</hi> is ſo far from owning any Accompliſhment of them in his time, that he doth plainly acquaint us, that the Covenant was not ſo much as ſtruck up, or as yet Actually made betwixt God and them: But as he tells us; <q>Behold the dayes come, ſaith the Lord, that I will do it;</q> So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is as far from owning any Accompliſhment of them in his Time: <q>For until this day <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> remaineth the ſame vail unta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§ 14. So that as it is clear, that the Mercies promiſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. were not fulfilled in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s, nor in <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s, nor in the Apoſtle's Time; So there is no Experience or Hiſtory that gives us any account that they were ever ſince fulfilled. And therefore neither indeed can we groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedly expect the Accompliſhment of them till the ſecond coming of the <hi>Deliverer,</hi> before ſpoken of, when that Prediction of the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 26. ſhall be fulfilled. <q>And ſo all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be ſaved. And no wonder, for this will be no other than the time of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50207:72"/> New Heavens, and the New Earth, mentioned <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 17, 18. For Behold I create new Heavens, and a New Earth, and the former ſhall not be remembred: But be you glad and rejoice for ever in that which I Create; for behold I create <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a Rejoicing, and her People a Joy; And the voice of weeping ſhall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. And ver. 23. they ſhall not Labour in vain, nor bring forth for Trouble; for they are the Seed of the bleſſed of the Lord, and their Off-ſpring with them.</q> With many other glorious Promiſes there Recorded, which are no way Applicable to the preſent ſtate of things in the Heavens and Earth that now are. And indeed the whole <hi>60th. chap.</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is taken up with Promiſes of this kind: And among the reſt, we are told. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <q>Thy People alſo ſhall be all Righteous, they ſhall inherit the Land for ever, the Branch of my Planting, that I may be glorified. <hi>So Chap.</hi> 61. 9. Their Seed alſo ſhall be known among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and their Off-ſpring among the People. All that ſee them ſhall acknowledge them that they are the Seed which the Lord hath bleſſed.</q> All of them moſt plainly Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that were never yet fulfilled, and therefore remain as yet to be Accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>§ 15. And indeed hitherto are to be Referred the ſeveral Paſſages that lie diſperſed up and down the Scriptures, concerning the Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Seed of the Righteous: For though no doubt, God hath a Gracious Reſpect unto many that are the Natural Deſcendants of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers now; and we may probably hope that the Grace of Election is for the moſt part continued in their Race; yet as God hath made no ſuch Covenant with us, <q>That he will be a God unto us, and to all our Natural Off ſpring, during the preſent Adminiſtration of things, in the Heavens and the Earth that now are.</q> So whatever Bleſſedneſs of that kind, God hath deſigned for his People, we have no Scripture ground to expect the Accompliſhment thereof, nor the <hi>Jews</hi> neither, till the time of the <hi>New Heavens, and the New Earth</hi> before ſpoken off; <hi>wherein</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> tells us) <hi>Righteouſneſs ſhall dwell.</hi> For then indeed, the People or Subjects of that ſtate <hi>ſhall be all Righteous, the Branch of Gods planting that he may be glorified,</hi> both they and their Off-ſpring al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. And therefore then, and not till then may we expect the fulfilling of thoſe Goſpel Promiſes before mentioned, concerning the <q>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of the Heart, both of them and their Seed alſo, to Love the Lord their God, with all their Heart, and with all their Soul:</q> Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaks no other than a time and ſtate of Perfection; when they ſhall have <q>no need any more to Teach every Man his Neighbour, nor eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man his Brother</q> (as now we muſt, and therefore not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the preſent ſtate of things) <q>Saying, Know the Lord; for they ſhall all know him from the leaſt unto the greateſt of them.</q>
               </p>

               <p>§. 16. From all which, it clearly appears, that the Promiſes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. are of a vaſtly different Nature, from what they have been generally imagined to be. And indeed are ſo far from being a part of the Legal Covenant at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> or of that Covenant which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with their little ones, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. That they remain as yet to be fulfilled. They might be Fulfilled, ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the time of the Judges. But why then were they ſo oft Captivated in the time of the Judges, as well as afterward by the <hi>Philiſtiues, Ammonites,</hi> &amp;c? And why were the Ten Tribes after carried away Captive by <hi>Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nazer,</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> So as that they have never ſince been hear'd of in the World, that we can underſtand? And why were the two Tribes afterward alſo carried away Captive by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and ſince Diſperſed by the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Powers; and ſo ſtill remain in a State of Diſperſion; as alſo in a State of Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and Oppoſition to the Goſpel unto this day? A few indeed were Converted by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the day of his firſt Appearance: But the Generality of the <hi>Jews</hi> were in Blindneſs after that, in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. and ſtill ſo rémain. And what was the Converſion of a few to the Fulfilling of the All of theſe Promiſes to the All of the <hi>Jews.</hi> But as ſure as God is True, and his Word moſt Faithful, there muſt be a time, when the forementioned Promiſes ſhall be Accompliſhed: When as the Fulneſs of the Gentiles ſhall come in, and be brought under the Obedience of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> So the Jews alſo muſt be Called, and the Fulneſs of them; by that <hi>Deliverer</hi> whom God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſhall yet <hi>come out of Zion, to turn away <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs from Jacob. For this is my Covenant unto them,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>when I ſhall take away their Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 17. And therefore, though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith true, when he tells us, p. 58. That <hi>Deut.</hi> 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. is a Goſpel Covenant; ſince the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. ſhews it in Expreſs Words: <q>(For ſaith he) when the Apoſtle had ſhewed, that the Righteouſneſs of the Law lieth in Perfect Obedience. <hi>He that doeth theſe things, ſhall live by them.</hi> He then ſheweth the Difference thus. <hi>But the Righteouſneſs which is of Faith, ſpeaketh on this wiſe: Say not in thine Heart, who ſhall Aſcend up to Heaven, to bring down Chriſt from Above,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But what ſaith it? The Word is nigh thee; even in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart; that is, the Word of Faith which we Preach.</hi> Now theſe words of Faith (ſaith he) the Apoſtſtle Citeth out of this very Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 11, 12, 13, 14.</q> But then it doth not therefore follow, that the Covenant mentioned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. and that, Chap. 29. is one
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50207:73"/> and the ſame Covenant. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> indeed takes it for granted that they are one and the ſame: And therefore to prove that that mentioned in the <hi>29th.</hi> Chapter is a Covenant of Grace, or a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Covenant; he Alledgeth theſe words in the <hi>6th.</hi> ver. of the <hi>30th.</hi> Chapter, for the Confirmation thereof; and hereon Bottoms his Argument; <q>[That becauſe the Jews with their little Ones, were entred into Covenant with God, in the <hi>29th.</hi> Chapter, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently were all Church-members; and foraſmuch as the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which the Infants who were then Church-members did paſs into, was a Covenant of Grace, or a Goſpel Covenant, (as diſtinct from the Law, which is Repealed;) therefore neither it, nor their Church-memberſhip is Repealed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§ 18. It cannot be denied but this is a Principal Argument which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> urgeth for the ſupport of his New Doctrine of the Church memberſhip of Infants, and conſequently their Baptiſm under the Goſpel: But how unjuſtly Urged, and how little it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to the Proof of what he intends it for, may by this time be eaſily Diſcerned; ſince by what hath been ſaid, it plainly appears, that the forementioned Scriptures in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> which he Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms it on, are by him greatly Abuſed and Miſ-repreſented, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the plain Scope of the Spirit of God in them: The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant mentioned in the <hi>29th.</hi> Chapter, and that in the <hi>30th.</hi> being not one and the ſame, as he would have it, but two Diſtinct and Eſſentially differrent Covenants The one being a Covenant of Works as hath been plainly proved, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5. which had Moſes for the Mediator of it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 1. For the Faultineſs whereof it is now Aboliſhed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 13. The other, a Covenant of Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 11, 12, 13, 14. which hath <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone for the Mediator of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6, 7, 8, 9. And ſhall therefore never be Aboliſhed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 34, 35, 36. The one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plainly of a Legal Stamp; the other Evangelical. The one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional; the other Abſolute. The one having its Exiſtence but for a time, upon an Occaſional Temporary Principle; the other ſuited to anſwer a Principle, Exiſting from Everlaſting, to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. The one being appointed only for the time then preſent, till the Incarnation of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the other reſpecting a time that is as yet to come. From all which it plainly follows, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſpoken of <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. is Eſſentinlly different from that which the Jews with their Little Ones, were then entered into Chap. 29. as being Eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes. So that there can be no juſt Inferrence drawn; that becauſe Infants were Fellow Covenanters with their Parents under the Legal Adminiſtration, that thus it is now under the Goſpel: For ſince it is Evident that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50207:73" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Law or Covenant it ſelf <hi>is changed;</hi> (as the Apoſtle Expreſly affirms it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12.) It doth as plainly follow, that the Seed is changed: The Goſpel Covenant that Believers are now under, requiring other manner of Subjects than the Legal did; as hath been already proved in the foregoing parts of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>§. 19. 'Tis true. in the time of the New <hi>Heavens</hi> and the New <hi>Earth,</hi> before ſpoken of, God hath promiſed not only to <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the Heart of his People, but of their Seed alſo, to love the Lord their God with all their Heart, and with all their Soul.</hi> That <hi>they ſhall teach no more every Man his Neighbour, and every Man his Brother, ſaying, know the Lord: For they ſhall all know him, from the leaſt of them, to the greateſt of them.</hi> That <hi>they ſhall be all Righteous, they and their Offspring, alſo the Branch of God's Planting, that he may be Glorified.</hi> But that will be ſuch a time and ſtate of Perfection, as we cannot now pretend unto. And therefore as the State and Condition of God's People now, is vaſtly different from what it was with them under the Law; ſo it is no leſs vaſtly different from that State of Bleſſedneſs, which both they and their Offspring alſo ſhall be Advanced unto, at the time before mentioned. So that what ever Priviledge the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of God's People ſhall then be Inveſted with; It hath been already proved, that God hath now appointed, that ſuch only as are Capable of making a Profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, are to be accounted as Viſible Members of the Goſpel Church, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the preſent Frame and Conſtitution thereof.</p>
               <p>§. 20. To conclude the preſent Point: Since it hath been now ſo plainly proved; That the Covenant which the Infants who were then Church-members, did paſs into, was not a Covenant of Grace, properly ſo called, whereof <hi>Chriſt</hi> is Mediator; nor a Goſpel, but a Legal Covenant, or a Covenant of Works, and that which is now Repealed. From hence it unavoidably follows, (and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own Grant) that the Church-memberſhip of Infants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was built upon it, or, as he ſaith, Inſeparably Conjunct, is alſo Repealed with it. And ſince the main Pillar for the ſupport of this new Doctrine, of the Church-memberſhip of Infants under the Goſpel, fails as it doth, it of neceſſity follows, that all the other Arguments which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath muſtered up to the ſame purpoſe, to the number of no leſs than 26. and thoſe again Multiplied and Sub-divided into a great many more, are all of them wholly Inſignificant alſo: Since no other conſideration whatſoever can ſufficiently demonſtrate the continuance of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, unleſs it could have been proved, that in its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Inſtitution, it had a Goſpel Covenant for the Foundation the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:50207:74" rendition="simple:additions"/> But the Contrary having been ſo plainly proved, it follows with an equal neceſſity, (and that according to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion) that there is no ſhadow of pretence left to aſſert the Church-memberſhip of Infants under the Goſpel Adminiſtration that now is. And if the Arguments for their Church-memberſhip do all of them fail, as we cannot but ſee they do: From hence it alſo plainly follows, that the Practice of Infants Baptiſm, which is Built thereon, muſt of neceſſity fall to the Ground, as having no Scripture Foundation left it for the Support thereof. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it is as Evident, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Book, called, <hi>Plain Scripture Proof of Infants Church-memberſhip and Baptiſm;</hi> carries with it nothing elſe but an empty Title. <hi>Vox &amp; praeterea nihil.</hi>

               <p>§. 2. As for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Argument for the Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Infants under the Goſpel, from <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. where we are told, that upon <hi>the Sounding of the Seventh Angel, there were great Voices in Heaven, ſaying the Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt.</hi> Which (ſaith he) Includes Infants as well as others that were to be the Members of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Church, or Kingdom. To this we ſhall only give this brief Reply; That this Scripture hath a plain reference to the time of the <hi>New Heavens,</hi> and the <hi>New Earth,</hi> which we have before ſpoken of; wherein all the Kingdoms of the World ſhall become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt; and all the Dominions of the Earth ſhall actually Serve and Obey him: For then indeed God hath promiſed, that <hi>his People ſhall be all Righteous, they and their Offspring alſo, the Branch of his Planting, that he may be Glorified,</hi> Iſa. 60. 21. which cannot be applied unto the preſent Adminiſtration of <hi>things in the Heavens and Earth that now are;</hi> wherein we cannot ſay, that one of a Hundred, much leſs that the whole Race of Believers are ſubject unto the Scepter of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and conſequently far from the true Goſpel Characters of Church-memberſhip in the Goſpel Church.</p>

               <p> § 3. As for Mr <hi>Allen</hi>'s other Inſtance concerning the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the <hi>Rechabites;</hi> wherein the Infants as well as thoſe of Age were Included: It is altogether as Inſignificant in our preſent Caſe, as the former concerning the <hi>Kohathites;</hi> or his other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance concerning thoſe little Children who were ſaid to <hi>enter into Covenant with God when their Parents did ſo,</hi> Deut 29. 11, 12, which hath been already Diſcuſſed. For doth it follow that be-becauſe the Children of the <hi>Rechahites</hi> were Engaged in a ſevere Ceremonial Covenant, together with their Parents, that therefore the Children of Believers are comprehended with themſelves in the Covenant of Grace? This would be indeed to make Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity to be Hereditary: But certain it is, that Grace doth not now run in a Blood, what ever it ſhall do; neither is the Grace of God now Tied or Entailed unto any Lineage of Men whtſoever. Though if it could be proved that all the Children of Believers were really and abſolutely Included in the ſame Covenant of Grace with their Parents; yet it follows not therefore that Baptiſm belongs unto them, till capable of making an Actual Profeſſion of their Faith in Chriſt, as hath been already proved. For it cannot juſtly be denied but that the Adminiſtration of Ordinances depends meerly upon the Law of Inſtitution, and hath varied in ſeveral Ages. From <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> there was no Ordinance to be Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to Infants. In <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time indeed Circumciſion was Inſtituted; which belongs peculiarly to the old Teſtament Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, and was part of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, which is now Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and done away. This was the firſt Ordinance that was Adminiſtred to Infants, and not to all Infants, but only to Male Infants, living in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, if they did Live to the Eighth day; otherwiſe they had no Right to it; though many of them doubtleſs in the Covenant of Grace, and ſo Saved: For want of an Inſtitution the like may be ſaid of Infants now; many of whom are in the Covenant of Grace, and ſo Saved by virtue of the Free-Promiſe; yet not to be Baptized, if they do not live to the time of Repenting, and Believing, the only time appointed for Baptiſm. For none ever had a Right to the Adminiſtrations of the Covenant, any otherwiſe than by virtue of a Poſitive Law. Now if the Natural Branches the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> had no Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to be Circumciſed, though in Covenant with their Father, but by virtue of a Divine Law, Expreſly requiring the ſame; neither can we expect that our Infants ſhould have any Right to Baptiſm, without the ſame Divine Warrant.</p>

               <p>WE ſhould here have put a Period to the preſent Diſcourſe, but that there remains yet ſomething further of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, which requires a Solemn Diſcuſſion, and Determination, according to the Light that ſhall be afforded unto us from the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50207:76"/> Holy Scriptures: And that is; Whereas Dr. <hi>Burthogge</hi> in his late Printed Diſcourſe upon the Subject of Infants Baptiſm; Aſſerts (as many others have done before him) that the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9. is the Covenant of Grace; or that Original Grant and Great Charter, by which Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles always did and do claim Heaven and Earth, and all the Promiſes they have Title to. From whence he infers, that they are to keep God's Covenant in the Goſpel Sign of it, that is Baptiſm; and that both by wearing of it themſelves, and alſo by putting it on all theirs; as <hi>Abraham</hi> was commanded to do, in reſpect of Circumciſion. And foraſmuch as the Miſtakes which the Generality of the World hath for ſome ſeaſon Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under, in reference to the true Nature of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the fore-cited Text, have been the very Ground and Foundation of moſt of the Arguments, which have of late (at leaſt) been inſiſted on in order to the Juſtification of Infants Baptiſm: We ſhall therefore the more Solemnly apply our ſelves toward a Subſtantial Diſcovery, or Detection threof; additional unto what hath been already offered in that reſpect, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going parts of this Diſcourſe. And if it can be Subſtantially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9. was not a Covenant of Grace, nor a Goſpel, but a Legal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or a Covenant of Works; and conſequently that the Gentiles are not concerned therein: From hence it will unavoidably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that all the Arguments thence deduced, for the ſupport of the fore-mentioned Practice, howſoever they may be formed, or framed, do of themſelves fall to the Ground.</p>
               <p>§ 2. In the firſt place then; though we do acknowledge, that God did indeed make a Covenant of Grace with Believing <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> Which is the Great Charter, by which Believing Gentiles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways did, and do claim both <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes they have Title to; yet that the Covenant of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, (for ſo it is called by <hi>Stephen, Acts.</hi> 7. 8.) which God made with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 7. 8, 9, 10. (though there was Grace in it, as there was in all the Covenants that God ever made with Men, as hath been before noted) is not a Covenant of Grace properly ſo called; nor a Goſpel Covenant, whereof Chriſt is the Mediator: And conſequently that the Gentiles are not concerned therein, is thus proved.</p>
               <p>If that Covenant was as much a Covenant of Works, as the Covenant of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 4, 5. and <hi>Edod.</hi> 20. and the Covenant mentioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 9, 10, 11. Nay, as much as the Covenant made with <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50207:76"/> 16. 17. where God tells him; <hi>Of the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou ſhalt not Eat: For in the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely Die.</hi> All which Were but ſeveral Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame Covenant of Works; then it is not a Goſpel Covenant, nor a Covenant of Grace, properly ſo called; whereof Chriſt is the Mediator.</p>
               <p>But it was as much a Covenant of Works as either of the Co-Covenants before mentioned were; therefore it is not a Covenant of Grace, nor a Goſpel Covenant, properly ſo called, whereof Chriſt alone is Mediator.</p>
               <p>§. 3. That the Covenant laſt mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 16, 17. was a Covenant of Works: We ſuppoſe none will (or can at leaſt Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally) deny: Foraſmuch as Life was Implicitely promiſed unto our Firſt Parent upon his Obedience, and Death was Explicitely threatned, or denounced upon him, in caſe of his Diſobedience. And upon theſe terms he was to Stand or Fall; which was plainly and undeniably a Covenant of Works, whereof Chriſt was not the Mediator. That the Covenant mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 4, 5. and Ch. 20. which God made with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> was of the ſame Stamp; the Scriptures are every where full in the Proof thereof. And as clear it is, that the Covenant mentioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 9, 10, 11. is but a Repetition of that made <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As hath been already proved. In reſpect of both which, it is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; that as Bleſſings were therein pronounced, and promiſed to the Obedient, upon <hi>Condition</hi> of their Obedience: So a Curſe was pronounced upon the Diſobedient. And thus <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>Moſes deſcribeth the Righteouſneſs of the Law; that the Man which doeth theſe things ſhall live by them.</hi> Which is a plain deſcription of a Covenant of Works; which he Citeth from <hi>Lev..</hi> 18. 5. <hi>You ſhall therefore keep my Statutes and Judgments; which if a Man do, he ſhall live in them.</hi> And accordingly the Apoſtle doth alſo tell us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. That <hi>as many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curſe: For it is Written,</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>(Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are contained in the Book of the Law, to do them.</hi> And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ver. 11, 12. <hi>That no man is Juſtified by the Law in the fight of God, is evident; for the Juſt ſhall Live by Faith. And the Law is not of Faith, but the Man that doeth them. ſhall live in them.</hi> Thoſe therefore that tell us that the Lavv is a Covenant of Faith, do plainly contradict the Apoſtle, vvho Expreſly tells us, that <hi>the Law is not of Faith; but the man that doeth them, ſhall live in them.</hi> And therefore plainly and undeniably a Covenant of Works. Thus it was with <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice, when God gave him
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50207:77"/> the Command before mentioned, <hi>Gen,</hi> 2. 16. and denounced the Sentence of Death upon him, in caſe of Diſobedience: upon the Account of which, it is generally Acknowledged, that he was then under a Covenant of Works. It is Evident therefore, that the Covenant mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. and Chap. 20. and that mentioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. were but two ſeveral Repetitions of the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works made with our Firſt Parent; and are frequently therefore in the Scripture Repreſented unto us under the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the <hi>Firſt, or Old Covenant, Heb.</hi> 8. 7. 13. Ch. 9. 15. 18. there being therein a clear and a plain Manifeſtation of the Law written in the Heart of Man at the Firſt.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Now, that the Covenant of Circumciſion made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his Seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9, 10. is of the ſame ſtamp or tenor with the three fore-mentioned Covenants, in <hi>Gen. Exod.</hi> and <hi>Deut.</hi> is alſo as Evident: For though 'tis true, God there promiſeth <hi>to be a God to Abraham, and to his Seed;</hi> yet ſtill it was upon Condition of Obedience, with an anſwerable threatning in caſe of Diſobedience: As it was with <hi>Adam</hi> before the Fall. <hi>In the day that thou Eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely Die.</hi> And as it was with them in the Wilderneſs; <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are Written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> So here ver. 9. <hi>Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant therefore, thou and thy Seed after thee, in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</hi> ver. 10. <hi>This is my Covenant which ye ſhall keep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and you, and thy Seed after thee; every Man-Child among you ſhall be Circumciſed.</hi> And ver. 14. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Man-child, whoſe Fleſh of his Fore-skin is not Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that Soul ſhall be cut off from his People: He hath broken my Covenant.</hi> The ſame terms with the former. Beſides, it is Evident that Circumciſion indiſpenſibly Obliged all that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it to a Perfect and Univerſal Obedience to the whole Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Will and Law of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>For I teſtifie to every man that is Circumciſed, that he is a Debtor to do the whole Law.</hi> If it was ſo in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, it was ſo in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time: And then it cannot be juſtly denied, but it was ſo in <hi>Abrahams</hi> alſo, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what of the Law, Mind, or Will of God, was then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto them. So that in this Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9, 10. 14. As Bleſſings are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon the Obedient upon <hi>Condition</hi> of their Obedience; ſo as great a Curſe is pronounced upon the Diſobedient. And as we have already ſaid is therefore of the ſame tenor with the Three fore-mentioned Covenants, in <hi>Geneſis, Exodus,</hi> and <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy.</hi> For did God tell our Firſt Parent in the Garden of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50207:77"/> 
                  <hi>Eden,</hi> concerning the Forbidden Fruit. <hi>In the day that thou Eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely Die?</hi> (and ſo in the reſt) we have the like Threatning here. <hi>He that is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed, that Soul ſhall be Cut off from his People: He hath broken my Covenant.</hi> And if that, were a Covenant of Works, why not this?</p>
               <p>§ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. And therefore though 'tis true God promiſed to <hi>Eſtabliſh his Covenant betwixt himſelf and Abraham, and his Seed after him in their Generations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for an Everlaſting Covenant, to be a God unto him, and to his Seed after him,</hi> ver. 7, &amp;c. Yet ſtill it was provided they kept his Covenant, and fulfilled the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof on their parts, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. 10. Elſe they were to be Cut off. And indeed the ſame Promiſes, for the Subſtance of them, were made unto the ſame People at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and upon the ſame Condition, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 4. 5. <hi>You have ſeen</hi> (ſaith God there) <hi>what I did unto the Aegyptians, and how I bear you on Eagles Wings, and brought you unto my ſelf. Now therefore, if ye will Obey my Voice indeed, and keep my Covenant. then ye ſhall be a peculiar Treaſure unto me, above all People, for all the Earth is mine.</hi> ve. 6. <hi>And ye ſhall be unto me a Kingdom of Priests, and an Holy Nation.</hi> And if this was a Covenant of Works, as the Apoſtle doth plainly Affirm it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5. from <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. Why not that made with <hi>Abraham</hi> alſo, ſince the terms are the ſame, as well as the Promiſes are the ſame? The like account the Scripture gives us of the Covenant mentioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. <hi>You have ſeen</hi> (ſaith Moſes there) ver. 2, 3. <hi>all that the Lord did before your Eyes in the Land of Egypt, unto Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, and all his Servants; the great Temptations which thine Eyes have ſeen, and thoſe great Miracles,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>Yet the Lord hath not given you an Heart to perceive, and Eyes to ſee, and Ears to hear, unto this day.</hi> ver. 5. 6. <hi>And I have led you forty years in the Wilderneſs; your clothes are not waxen old upon you,—That ye might know, that I am the Lord your God,</hi> ver. 9. <hi>Keep therefore the words of this Covenant, and do them, that ye may proſper in all that ye do.</hi> The ſame Language with that <hi>Exod,</hi> 19. 5. and <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5. So that we cannot but plainly ſee, that all thoſe fore-mentioned Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, are of one and the ſame Nature; what the one is, the others are the ſame. And therefore if the Covenant made with our Firſt <hi>Parent</hi> before the Fall, and that made with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> were neither of them a Covenant of Grace, nor a Goſpel Covenant; whereof Chriſt is the alone and only Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator: For the ſame Reaſon, neither was that mentioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. nor that <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9. as being all of the ſame tenor,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50207:78"/> and the Promiſes in them all of a like Nature.</p>
               <p>§ 6. <q>The whole entire Nature, (ſaith Dr. <hi>Owen)</hi> of the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> conſiſted in this; <hi>That upon our Perſonal Obedience, according unto the Law and Rule of it, we ſhould be Accepted with God, and Rewarded with him.</hi> Herein the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of it did conſiſt. And what ever Covenant proceedeth on theſe terms, or hath the Nature of them in it; however it may be varied with Additions or Alterations, is the ſame Covenant ſtiil, and not another. As in the Renovation of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> wherein the <hi>Eſſence of the Covenant of Grace</hi> was contained, God did oft times make other Additions unto it, as unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> yet was it ſtill the <hi>ſame Covenant,</hi> for the Subſtance of it, and not another: So whatever Variations may be made in, or Additions unto the Diſpenſation of the <hi>Firſt Covenant,</hi> ſo long as this Rule is retained, <hi>Do this and Live;</hi> it is ſtill the ſame Covenant for the Subſtance and Eſſence of it.</q> Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in his late Diſcourſe Entituled, <hi>The Doctrine of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, by Imputed Righteouſneſs.</hi> p. 397.</p>

               <p>BUt foraſmuch as Mr. <hi>Roberts,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> and many other Divines who have Written upon the Covenants, do affirm, that the Covenant at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was a Covenant of Faith; or, which is all one, a Covenant of Grace: At leaſt that it was <hi>Subſerviently</hi> the Covenant of Grace: Or a Covenant of Grace for the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of it, though propounded in a more dark way, and in a manner fitting for the State of that People, and that preſent time and Condition of the Church.

We ſhall therefore the more Intently apply our ſelves toward the Diſcovery of their great Miſtakes in this Reſpect; it being of ſo vaſt an Importance to the Church of God, to be ſet at rights herein; on which (as all will grant) So much of the Superſtructure of the Chriſtian Faith and Practice depends. For this purpoſe therefore (Additional unto what hath been already ſaid (we ſhall only premiſe two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, proving that the Covenant at Mount Sinai mentioned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. and <hi>Exod</hi> 20. was no other than a Covenant of Works.

               <p>§. 2. In the firſt place then; that the Covenant at Mount Sinai before mentioned was no other then a Covenant of Works: We thus prove.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:50207:78"/>
               <p> Firſt, that Covenant that is not of Faith, cannot be a Covenant of Faith, but of Works: But the Apoſtle doth Expreſly affirm, that <hi>the Law is not of Faith, Gal.</hi> 3. 11, 12. Which is moſt plainly to be underſtood of Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant; therefore that Covenant cannot be a Covenant of Faith, but of Works.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that Covenant which is now Repealed, could not be a Covenant of Grace, but of Works.

And if we will know the reaſon why the Covenant of Works ſhould be thus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed after the Fall; the Scripture Expreſly tells us: That <hi>the Law was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſions, till the Seed ſhould come to whom the Promiſe was made,</hi> Gal. 3. 19. The Apoſtle had before told us, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. That <hi>the Covenant that was Confirmed before of God in Chriſt, the Law which was</hi> 430. <hi>Years after, could not Diſannul that it ſhould make the Promiſe of none Effect, wherefore then</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>ver.</hi> 19.) <hi>Serveth the Law?</hi> To which himſelf gives this Reſolution: That <hi>it was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſions, till the Seed ſhould come to whom the Promiſe was made.</hi> And elſevvhere the ſame Apoſtle Informs us: That <hi>the Law entered that the Offence might abound,</hi> Rom. 5. 20. Or as he Expreſſeth it, Chap. 7. 13. <hi>That Sin by the Commandment</hi> might <hi>become exceeding Sinful.</hi> It being Evident that the Lavv vvas appointed as a <hi>School-maſter to Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3. 24. For ſo it vvas to the Jevvs; that is, to ſhevv them the Nature of Sin, and the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50207:79"/> Holineſs and Righteouſneſs of God; to convince them of their Sin and Miſery vvithout Chriſt, and their neceſſity therefore of a Saviour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7, 12. 13. And for this purpoſe it ſtill ſerves to all Men in an unregenerate State <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. But though the Lavv doth indeed ſhevv us our Neceſſity of Chriſt, and our Miſery vvithout him; yet it doth not <hi>bring us to Chriſt</hi> (as our Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath it) for that is the Work of the Covenant of Faith only, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8, 9.

In the <hi>mean time,</hi> ſome Order muſt be taken about <hi>Sin and Tranſgreſſion,</hi> that all the Order of things appointed of God, vvere not Overflovved by them. And this vvas done tvvo vvays by the Lavv. [1.] By Reviving the Commands of the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> vvith the Sanction of Death, it put an Avve on the minds of Men, and ſet Bounds unto their Luſts, that they ſhould not dare to run forth into that Exceſs vvhich they vvere Naturally inclined unto. It vvas therefore <hi>added becauſe of Tranſgreſſions,</hi> that in the Declaration of God's Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt them ſome Bounds might be fixed unto them: <hi>For the knowledge of Sin is by the Law.</hi> [2.] <hi>To ſhut up <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> and ſuch as vvould not ſeek for Righteouſneſs, Life, and Salvation by the Promiſe, under the Povver of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, and Curſe attending it. <hi>It concluded, or ſhut up all under Sin,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, ver. 20. This vvas the end

               <p>§. 5. It is true, that Scripture, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 24. vvhere the Apoſtle tells us that <hi>the Law was our School-Maſter to Chriſt, that we might be Juſtified by Faith,</hi> is ſtrongly urged by ſome, to prove that the <hi>Law</hi> muſt needs be therefore a <hi>Covenant of Faith.</hi> But it is Evident, that the School maſterſhip of the Lavv, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Faith are tvvo quite different things; as appears by the Words before and after. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>Before Faith came</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we were kept under the Law, ſhut up unto the Faith which ſhould afterward be Revealed.</hi> ver. 24. <hi>Wherefore the Law was our School-maſter to Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by Faith.</hi> ver. 25. <hi>But after that Faith is come, we are no longer under a School-maſter.</hi> So that the Schol maſterſhip of the Lavv is one thing, and the Covenant of Faith another: For vvhen the one cometh, the other ceaſeth. When the one takes place the other vaniſheth. The Lavv therefore could not be a Covenant of Faith, it being here ſo plainly Oppoſed or Contra diſtinguiſhed thereunto. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Apoſtle elſevvhere aſſures us, that <hi>the Law Written and Engraven in Stones was a Miniſtration of Death and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. 7. 9. And conſequently gave no hopes of Relief to the Miſerable Sinner as the Covenant of Faith doth. It convinc'd him indeed of the dreadful Nature of Sin; and of the Infinite Purity and Holineſs of Gods Nature and Being, againſt whom it had Sinned; but it left no Room for Repentance. For <hi>Curſed is every one</hi> (ſaith the Law) <hi>that Continueth not in all things which are Written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> Therefore it is calld <hi>the Hand-writing of Ordinances that was againſt us, which was contrary to us; which Chriſt took out of the way, nailing it to his Croſs,</hi> Col. 2. 14. So that the Law could not poſſibly be a Covenant of Faith: It being conſtantly repreſented to us in the Scripture, as being of a vaſtly different Nature therefrom, and that in the very <hi>Eſſence</hi> or <hi>Subſtance</hi> thereof. The one being a <hi>Miniſtration of Death and Condemnation,</hi> the other a <hi>Miniſtration of Life and Peace.</hi>

               <p>WE are told indeed by Mr. <hi>Obadiah Segdwick,</hi> in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon the Covenant of Grace, p. 175. <q>That the Covenant made with the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> was at leaſt ſubſerviently the Covenant of Grace; a Covenant of Grace for the Subſtance of it though propounded in a more dark way, and in a manner, fitting for the State of that People, and that preſent time and condition of the Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. But this is but an Evaſion, and ſerves for no other purpoſe than to darken the Truth: For the thing is plain, that the Law was as much a Covenant of Works, as that made with our Firſt Parent. <q>The Jewiſh Legal Covenant (ſaith Dr. <hi>Anneſly</hi> in his Sermon upon the Covenant of Grace; <hi>Morning Exerciſe,</hi> p. 122) Neither admitted of Faith in the Redeemer, nor Repentance of Sin: For Pardon of ſin and Curſe for Sin are Inconſiſtent, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>As many as are of the Works of the Law are under the Curſe:</hi> For it is Written, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are Written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> As many as depend upon the Works of the Law for Juſtification, are under the Curſe. And the Law (ſaith he) diſcovered no other way of Juſtification, but by Works.</q> Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> alſo in the ſame <hi>Morning Exerciſe,</hi> p. 117. tells us, <q>That <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law is oppoſed to the Covenant of Grace, as another Covenant, upon this very diſtinguiſhing account of Obedience and Faith, Works and Grace; as you may ſee (ſaith he) at large among other Places, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. The Law therefore was not ſo much as <hi>Subſerviently</hi> a Covenant of Faith, much leſs for the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of it ſo; for it is quite another thing, and is conſtantly ſo repreſented unto us in the Scriptures. The Apoſtle ſaith indeed, <hi>The Law was our School-maſter to Chriſt</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> He doth not ſay <hi>to bring us</hi> to Chriſt, as our Tranſlation hath it: (For as we have already ſaid, that is the Work of the Covenant of Faith only) And therefore that Notion, that the Law was <hi>Subſerviently</hi> a Covenant of Faith hath no Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: Thoſe Words <hi>[to bring us]</hi> being unduly added to the Original Text, and are accordingly put in a Different Character in our Tranſlation thereof. But, (ſaith the Apoſtle in the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following) <hi>After that Faith is come, we are no longer</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:50207:80"/> 
                  <hi>under a School-maſter.</hi> But how can that be if the Law was a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Faith? Muſt the Covenant of Faith ceaſe; at leaſt in this World? Muſt the Covenant of Faith <hi>Vaniſh,</hi> be <hi>Blotted out; taken out of the way,</hi> and <hi>done away,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the <hi>Law?</hi> Or was the Covenant of Faith <hi>againſt us, and contrary to us,</hi> as he ſpeaks of <hi>the Hand-writing of Ordinances,</hi> that is now <hi>Blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out.</hi> And indeed therefore, neither could the Law be ſo much as <hi>Subſerviently</hi> a Covenant of Faith: For if it had, the Apoſtle would never have deſcribed it as hath been now declared.</p>
               <p>§. 4. And 'tis in vain to ſay, <q>That <hi>the Law was a Covenant of Faith, though propunded in a more dark way, and in a manner, fitting for the State of that People, and that preſent Time and Condition of the Church,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> ſpeaks.)</q> For the Apoſtle Expreſly affirms, that <hi>the Law is not of Faith:</hi> (It is not of Faith Abſolutely, not Comparatively) <hi>but the man that doth them, ſhall live in them,</hi> Gal. 3. 12. The Law therefore was no other than a Covenant of Works, ſince not only the Apoſtle doth here aſſure us, that it is not of Faith, but alſo the ſame Rule, <hi>Do this and Live,</hi> is that ſtill retained therein as at firſt. And it is therefore different from the Covenant of Faith; not barely in reſpect of the <hi>Degrees</hi> or clearneſs of the Revelation of Goſpel-Grace, (as is commonly Suggeſted:) For the Law, as hath been already proved, diſcovers none at all, but leaves the guilty Sinner wholly Remedileſs, without the leaſt glimps of Light or Comfort. The Law therefore differs from the Covenant of Faith <hi>Specifically,</hi> in reſpect of the whole <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Eſſence</hi> of it. In which reſpect the Law could never be appointed as a School-maſter <hi>to bring us</hi> to Chriſt. Well it may convince us of our <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of him; but bring us to him it cannot.</p>
               <p>§ 5. So that then theſe are the Reaſons which the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> himſelf Suggeſteth, why the Law was added? Or why the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works was Revived after Man's Fall, and even after the Proclaiming of the firſt Promiſe concerning the Womans Seed, <hi>Gen,</hi> 3. 15. which was renewed to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22. 18. <hi>It was added,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>becauſe of Tranſgreſſions, till the Seed ſhould come to whom the Promiſe was made.</hi> And <hi>it entered that the Offence might abound.</hi> It being appointed as a School-maſter to Chriſt, to convince the Jews of their neceſſity of a Saviour. And ſince it cannot be denied, but that all the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> muſt of Neceſſity be under one or another of the two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants; either that of Works, or that of Grace; And ſince <hi>all Men by Nature are Children of Wrath,</hi> Eph. 2, 3. And ſince it would be utterly abſurd to affirm, that ſuch are under a Covenant of Grace till-Converted: It of neceſſity follows, that unto ſuch the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50207:81" rendition="simple:additions"/> Covenant of Works is ſtill in force, and under it they are till wrought upon by the Grace of the Goſpel; the Law abating nothing, but ſtill exacting the <hi>utmoſt Farthing.</hi> Neither from the Impoſſibility of Man's yielding that perfect Obedience which that Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; can we juſtly conclude that therefore it is not ſtill in Force: For <hi>God hath not forfeited or loſt his Right of Dominion, though we have loſt our Strength or Capacity of Obedience.</hi> So that it is evident, that the Law given upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to the People of the Wilderneſs; or the Law written in Stones, (which was a plain and clear Manifeſtation of the Law written in the Heart of Man at the firſt) was no other than a Covenant of Works. Thus it was to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and thus it ſtill continues in its full Power, Force and Virtue to all Men in an Unregenerate State. <hi>For what things ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the Law, that every Month may be ſtopped, and all the World may become Guilty before God,</hi> Rom. 3. 19.</p>

               <p>NEither was the Law by the <hi>Jews</hi> only Interpreted as a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works,</hi> but as it is evident by <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, and by <hi>Paul</hi> alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We are told indeed by Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> in his fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Diſcourſe upon the Covenants, p. 173. <q>That we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the intention of God in giving the Law, and the Abuſe or Perverting of the Law. We grant (ſaith he) that many of the <hi>Jews</hi> did ſet up a Legal Righteouſneſs for their Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and reſted upon the Works of the Law, as if Life came by them; againſt which <hi>Paul</hi> doth notably Argue in his Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians.)</hi> But this, ſaith he, was not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of God in the Sanction of Law. They could never find a juſtifying Righteouſneſs by the Law, or Works of the Law, under the Notion of a Covenant of Works; nor did God ever propound it for that end.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§ 2. For Anſwer hereunto we ſay; That ſince, by Mr. <hi>Sedgwicks</hi> own confeſſion, the <hi>Jews</hi> could never find a Juſtifying Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the Law, or by the Works of it. From hence it inevitably follows, that it could not be a Covenant of Faith. Sure it is that the Covenant of Faith <hi>Juſtifies</hi> all that are under it: For <hi>being Juſtified by Faith, we have Peace with God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. That Covenant therefore that could never Juſtifie any that were under it, could never be a Covenant of Faith: But the <hi>Scripture</hi> is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, that by <hi>the deeds of the Law there ſhall no Fleſh be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in God</hi>'s <hi>ſight,</hi> Rom. 3. 20. Therefore that Covenant could never be a Covenant of Faith. And yet again, that Covenant under
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50207:81"/> which though many were Juſtified; yet none were ever <hi>Juſtified by it,</hi> or <hi>by virtue of it,</hi> could never be a Covenant of Faith: But ſuch was the nature of the Law, that though many were Juſtified <hi>under it,</hi> yet none were ever Juſtified <hi>by it,</hi> or <hi>by virtue of it,</hi> Rom. 3. 20. Therefore that Covenant could never be a Covenant of Faith. And if the Law was not a Covenant of Faith, then, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t muſt of neceſſity follow, that it could be no other than a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works. And indeed ſo it was appointed and declared by God himſelf, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. <hi>Ye ſhall therefore keep my Statutes and Judgments; which if a man do, he ſhall live in them.</hi> And this the Spirit of God by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> takes ſpecial notice of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>For Moſes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>deſcribeth the Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, That the man that doth theſe things ſhall live by them.</hi> And what can be a more plain Deſcription of a Covenant of Works, and that of God's own Deſignation and Appointment? And that not in the way of a Partial imperfect Obedience: But <hi>as it is Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. which the Apoſtle quotes from <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26. <hi>Curſed be be that Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not all the words of this Law to do them. And all the People ſhall ſay</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p>§. 3. So that the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>right enough</hi> in their Notion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Law, in reference to the <hi>true Nature</hi> thereof, that it was indeed a Covenant of Works, (For <hi>Paul</hi> doth plainly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be ſuch, and God himſelf by the Mouth of his Servant <hi>Moſes</hi> as plainly expreſſeth it ſo to be, in the very firſt Sanction of it) though they were out in reſpect of its proper <hi>uſe and intention;</hi> which was not that any ſhould attain unto Life and Righteouſneſs thereby: but as we have before obſerved, to ſhew them the Nature of Sin, and the Holineſs and Righteouſneſs of God; to convince them of their Sin and Miſery without <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and their neceſſity therefore of a Saviour; which they being ignorant of and ſtill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to Eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, which was of the Law; and refuſing to ſubmit themſelves unto the Righteouſneſs of God, (which was now Manifeſted without the Law, as it had been before Witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets) They Stumbled at that Stumbling-ſtone, and were accordingly Broken and Snared and Taken, <hi>Rom,</hi> 9. 31, 32, 33. Chap. 10. 3. And this was the true ground of the Diſpute between the Apoſtle and them.</p>
               <p>§ 4. But all this notwithſtanding; it is evident that the Law was a Covenant of Works ſtill. And it is alſo as evident, that it was Appointed and Eſtabliſhed by God as a diſtinct Covenant from the Promiſe of Grace, and eſſentially different therefrom, under which the Natural Poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> were for a Seaſon to be Subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50207:82"/> until <hi>the time appointed of the Father,</hi> Gal. 4. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Fruit of infinite Wiſdom, who thought fit to impoſe this Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then upon them, notwithſtanding, or rather <hi>Additional</hi> unto thoſe Diſcoveries of Grace: (For the Law is ſaid to have been <hi>Added un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Promiſe)</hi> that had been otherwiſe Revealed unto them, and whereby they were Saved. So that the forementioned Objection notwithſtanding it ſtill remains Firm and Unſhaken, that the Law was no other than a Covenant of Works: So it was deſigned and appointed by God himſelf; and conſtantly in the Scripture is it Repreſented to us under that Character.</p>

               <p>BUt whereas the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>the Law is not againſt the Promiſes,</hi> Gal. 3. 21. Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> will needs hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Law was not a Covenant of Works: <q>For (ſaith he) <hi>The Law is not againſt the Promiſes;</hi> nor doth <hi>Faith make void the Law.</hi> Both theſe can very well agree together; but ſo they could not if the Law had been given as a Covenant of Works: For now the Law would be Expreſly againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and Faith will certainly make void the Law. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God are contrary to a Covenant of Works, and Faith is Deſtructive to a Covenant of Works. If therefore the Promiſes and Faith, and the Law can conſiſt, then the Law cannot be ſet up as a Covenant of Works.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. To this we Reply; Firſt, That it ought to be duly Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Law and the Promiſe having <hi>divers ends,</hi> it doth not therefore follow that there is an Inconſiſtency between them: For although there is nothing that can be clearer than this, That the Law was ſet up and appointed by God, as a Covenant of Works to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to convince them of Sin, and the neceſſity of a Saviour; yet did God never intend it as a Means to <hi>give Life and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs:</hi> nor was it able ſo to do. The <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Primiſe</hi> was to give Life, Righteouſneſs, Juſtification and Salvation; all by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> to whom, and concerning whom it was made. But this was not the end for which the Covenant of Works was Revived, in the Covenant of <hi>Sinai.</hi> For although in its ſelf it requires a perfect Righteouſneſs, and gives a promiſe of Life thereon, <hi>He that doth theſe things, ſhall live in them;</hi> yet it could <hi>give</hi> neither Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs nor Life to any in a State of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. Chap. 10. 4. Wherefore the Promiſe and the Law having <hi>divers ends,</hi> they are not <hi>contrary</hi> to one another. Nay, rather the Law even as it is a Covenant of Works, inſtead of being <hi>againſt</hi> the Promiſe, it tends to the <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> of it, by declaring the <hi>Impoſſibility of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:50207:82"/> 
                  <hi>Reconciliation and Peace with God,</hi> any other way, but <hi>by the Promiſe:</hi> For repreſenting the Commands of the Covenant of Works, requiring perfect Sin-leſs Obedience, under the Penalty of the Curſe; it convinced Men, that this was no way for Sinners to ſeek for Life and Salvation by. And herewith it ſo urged the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of Men, that they could have no Reſt nor Peace in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but what the Promiſe would afford them; whereunto there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſaw a neceſſity of betaking themſelves. So that though we affirm the Law to be no other than a Covenant of Works, as the Apoſtle himſelf doth; yet it doth not therefore follow that it is againſt the Promiſe, it having ſo Bleſſed a Subſerviency toward the Eſtabliſhment thereof.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Secondly, though the Apoſtle doth indeed tell us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21. That <hi>the Law is not againſt the Promiſes.</hi> The following Words do ſufficiently clear his Meaning to be of quite another Nature than Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> in his forementioned Diſcourſe, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends it to be. Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> indeed will by no-means allow that the Law was ſet up as a <hi>Covenant of Works;</hi> and then it muſt of neceſſity follow, that it is a <hi>Covenant of Faith.</hi> But the Apoſtle ſeems to be of another mind: For having told us, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. That <hi>if the Inheritance be of the Law, it is no more of Promiſe: But God gave it to</hi> Abraham <hi>by Promiſe.</hi> And having anſwered the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, or Objection, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>Wherefore then ſerveth the Law?</hi> To which himſelf gives this Reſolution, That <hi>it was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſions, till the Seed ſhould come to whom the Promiſe was made.</hi> He brings in this further Objection, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. againſt what he had before Aſſerted, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>if the Inheritance be of the Law, it is no more of Promiſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Is the Law then againſt the Promiſes? God forbid,</hi> (ſaith he.) <hi>For if there had been a Law given which could have given Life, verily Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law: But the Scripture hath concluded all under Sin, that the Promiſe by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe.</hi> In the firſt place then it is Evident and Undeniable, that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Inheritance was not derived unto him through the Law: For, (ſaith our Apoſtle) <hi>If the Inheritance be of the Law, it is no more of Promiſe; but God gave it to</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>by Promiſe.</hi> So that it clearly appears by the ſcope of the Apoſtle's Argument, that the Law could not be a Covenant of Faith: For if it had, it would have been honoured as an Inſtrument for the conveyance of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Inheritance: But, ſaith he, God gave it to <hi>Abraham</hi> by Promiſe, not by the Law; therefore the Law could not be a Covenant of Faith. But <hi>is the Law then againſt the Promiſes? God forbid,</hi> (ſaith he.) <hi>For if there had been a Law given, which could have given Life, verily</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:50207:83"/> 
                  <hi>Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law; but the Scripture hath concluded all under Sin, that the Promiſe of Faith by Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that Believe.</hi> So that the Law could not be a Covenant of Faith, ſince the Apoſtle doth here ſo plainly diſtinguiſh between them; ſetting forth the Weakneſs of the one, and the Strength and Perfection of the other. The Law (ſaith he) <hi>Could not give Life; but the Covenant of Faith doth.</hi> The Law indeed would, but could not: It promiſeth Life, but it could not perform it through the Weakneſs of the Fleſh. (So there is no Repugnancy in the Law againſt the Promiſes) but what the Law could not do, the Covenant of Faith performeth: For it not only promiſeth Life, but accompliſheth what it hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and ſets the Soul in Safety.</p>
               <p>§ 4. According to the plain and clear Scope of the Apoſtle's Reaſoning, therefore; the Law is ſo far from being a Covenant of Faith, that it is quite another thing. For if it had been a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Faith, it would have given Life, as the Covenant of Faith doth: But it could not give Life, therefore it could be no other than a Covenant of Works. But <hi>is the Law then againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes? God forbid,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul;</hi> and ſo ſay we. For ſuppoſing the Law to be, as it is indeed, a pure Covenant of Works; yet through the Satisfaction of Chriſt, there is no Repugnancy, or Hoſtile Contrariety betwixt the Law and the Promiſes, or between the Law and Faith, which hath reſpect to the Promiſes. There is only a difference of Deficiency, in reſpect of that Strength that there is in the one, to what there was in the other. The one being Weak through the Fleſh; the other Strong and Powerful, and goes through-ſtitch with its Work. But what the Law could not do through our Weakneſs, that Chriſt hath performed, by fulfilling its Commands, and ſubmitting to its Curſe, on our behalf; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God's Juſtice is ſatisfied, and Everlaſting Righteouſneſs obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the Salvation of Sinners. And indeed herein conſiſteth the Covenant of Faith; here is the Object of it, and in this path is the very <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God it ſelf moſt highly Glorified. Shall we ſay then, that becauſe the Law is a Covenant of Works, that it is therefore <hi>againſt the Promiſes? God forbid.</hi> For <hi>who ſhall lay any thing to the Charge of God's Elect,</hi> ſo as to hinder the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Promiſes upon them? The Law it ſelf doth not, cannot Impeach them, ſince <hi>it is God that Juſtifieth.</hi> Or, <hi>Who ſhall Condemn</hi> them? The Law it ſelf cannot; ſince <hi>it is Chriſt that Died.</hi> It is true, the Law ſaith, That <hi>the man that doth theſe things, ſhall Live by them.</hi> And indeed herein the very Eſſence of the Covenant of Works conſiſteth. But the Covenant of Faith leads us to what <hi>Christ</hi> hath done and performed for us;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50207:83"/> which the Covenant of Works doth not. But though the Law leads us not to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yet <hi>Chriſt being made under it,</hi> and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it its due honour on our behalf; hence it follows, that the Law it ſelf that was before our Enemy, ſtands up as our Friend: Even that Law that was before <hi>againſt us,</hi> which was <hi>Contrary to us,</hi> and which was in it ſelf no other than <hi>the Miniſtration of Death and Condemnation;</hi> even that Law ſtands up as our Friend, through the Mediation of <hi>Chriſt, whom God</hi> therefore <hi>hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood to declare his Righteouſneſs that he might be Juſt, and the Juſtifier of him that Believeth in Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 3. 24, 25, 26. So that the Law (through the Satisfaction of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> though it be, as it is indeed a Covenant of Works; yet) is not <hi>againſt the Promiſes;</hi> there is no <hi>Real Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy,</hi> or <hi>Contrariety</hi> between them, whatever there ſeems to be: Which made the Apoſtle Propound the Queſtion as he doth.</p>
               <p>§ 5. Beſides, the ſame Apoſtle that tells us, <hi>The Law is not againſt the Promiſes,</hi> doth alſo expreſly Aſſure us, <hi>That the Law is not of Faith, but the Man that doth them ſhall live by them,</hi> Gal. 3. 12. So that though it is true, the Law is not againſt the Promiſes, <hi>Since Mercy and Truth, Righteouſneſs and Peace are met together in Chriſt;</hi> yet it is as true, that <hi>the Law is not of Faith.</hi> And if the Law is not of Faith; then neither can it be a Covenant of Faith, but of Works; as the ſame Apoſtle doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27, 28. And therefore neither could it give Life: For if it could, Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by it: But (ſaith he) <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all under Sin, that the Promiſe by Faith of Jeſus Christ might be given to them that Believe.</hi> The Law therefore was not a Covenant of Faith: For if it had, it would have given Life, and ſo Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law: But it could not give Life, and ſo Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs was not by the Law, therefore it was not a Covenant of Faith. The like Inference may be clearly drawn from <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5, 6, &amp;c. <hi>Moſes</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Deſcribeth the Righteouſneſs of the Law, that the Man which doth theſe things ſhall live by them. But the Righteouſneſs which is of Faith,</hi> (or Goſpel Covenant) ſpeaketh on this wiſe, <hi>&amp;c. If thou Believeſt, thou ſhalt be Saved.</hi> Wherein we cannot but obſerve, that the Apoſtle maketh a plain difference betwixt the Righteouſneſs of the Law, and the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith. The one, ſaith he, ſpeaketh after this ſort; the other ſpeaketh after quite another rate, From whence alſo it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows, that the Law could not be a Covenant of Faith; ſince the Righteouſneſs of the one is here ſo plainly Oppoſed to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the other; which yet it would not be, had the Law been a Covenant of Faith; nay, though it had been ſo only more
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50207:84"/> 
                  <hi>Darkly,</hi> and not with that clearneſs of Demonſtration as the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Reveals it; had it been ſo <hi>Subſerviently</hi> only; much more if it had been ſuch for the Subſtance of it, as it Affirmed. For it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagined, that if it had been a Covenant of Grace, or a Covenant of Faith <hi>Subſerviently,</hi> much more if it had been ſuch for the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of it; that ever it would have been ſet in point blank <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to it, as quite <hi>another thing,</hi> as it is. When the Apoſtle tells us therefore, that the Righteouſneſs which is of the Law ſaith, <hi>Do this, and Live;</hi> but the Righteouſneſs of Faith ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in quite another <hi>Dialect:</hi> It is plain there is a difference between them <hi>toto Genere;</hi> or in the whole <hi>Kind,</hi> or <hi>Subſtance</hi> thereof, and not barely in the ſeveral <hi>Degrees of Manifeſtation;</hi> as is ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted: For as the Apoſtle Reaſoneth concerning Election, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. So it is here. <hi>If it be of Works, then it is no more Grace; otherwiſe Work is no more Work. And if by Grace, then it is no more of Works; otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace.</hi> Either there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law was a Covenant of Grace, or it was a Covenant of Works: If it was a Covenant of Grace, then according to the ſcope of the Apoſtle's Reaſoning, it was not a Covenant of Works; or <hi>it is no more of Works;</hi> that is, it is not of Works at all: And conſequently <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not deſcribe the Righteouſneſs which is of the Law as he doth, <hi>that the Man that doth theſe things, ſhall live by them.</hi> But if this be abſurd, and it be evident that it is, as it is indeed, a Covenant of Works: For the ſame Reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither can it in any Sence, be a Covenant of Goſpel-Grace; otherwiſe (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>Work is no more Work.</hi> For theſe two, Grace and Works, or Faith and Works, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the Scripture oppoſed the one unto the other, in point of our Juſtification before God's Preſence, (which is our preſent caſe) and admit of no Mixture.</p>
               <p>§. 6. So that though the Law (even as it is a Covenant of Works) is not <hi>againſt the Promiſes;</hi> that is, there is no Repugnancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; there being a ſweet Harmony and Conjunction of all the Bleſſed Attributes of God in Chriſt in the way of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sinners; yet the Law is conſtantly in the Scripture repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in a way of <hi>Contradiſtinction</hi> to the Promiſes; and ſo it is in the words foregoing, as hath been already obſerved, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the Inheritance be of the Law, it is no more of Promiſe; but God gave it to</hi> Abraham <hi>by Promiſe.</hi> And (which is yet clearer) the ſame Apoſtle doth alſo aſſure us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 14. That <hi>if they which are of the Law be heirs, Faith is made void, and the Promiſe made of none Effect.</hi> Therefore the Law could not poſſibly be a Covenant of Faith, but of Works.</p>

               <p>ANd whereas the Apoſtle doth alſo tell us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 31. <hi>That we do not make Void the Law through Faith, but Eſtabliſh it.</hi> This alſo is true, and no way Contradicteth, but is Conſiſtent enough with what hath been Aſſerted, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Law is no other than a Covenant of Works: Foraſmuch as Chriſt our ſurety hath fulfilled it for us, given it its due Honour, and ſatisfied its Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty on our behalf. So that we are ſo far from making void the Law, through Faith; that it is rather thereby Eſtabliſhed; as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received greater Honour by the obedience and Sufferings of Chriſt, than ever could have been given it by us.</p>
               <p>§. 2. And yet further, (which is alſo Objected to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole as before) whereas the Apoſtle doth alſo tell us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. That <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth.</hi> The Sence is Evident: Foraſmuch as <hi>what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the Fleſh; God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of Sinful Fleſh, and for Sin</hi> (or by a Sacrifice for Sin) <hi>Condemned Sin in the Fleſh, that the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fullfilled in us</hi> (that is in the Perſon of our ſurety for us) <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 3, 4. And thus <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth,</hi> by fulfilling its Commands, and anſwering its Penalty on our behalf. But doth it therefore follow that the Law is a Covenant of Faith? It is Evident that Chriſt Submitted to it as a Covenant of Works. And if it was ſo to Chriſt, it was ſo to us, and would have been ſo, and the Curſe thereof had accordingly lighted on us, had not Chriſt Interpoſed for our Relief. <hi>But,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>when the Fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, made under the Law, to Redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons,</hi> Gal. 4. 4, 5. From whence it clearly appears, that the Law was not a Covenant of Faith: For if it had, what neceſſity was there for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have Redeemed us from under it? Can we imagine that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ever ſhed his Blood to Redeem us from being under a Covenant of Faith, or from being under a Goſpel Covenant? The Law was therefore no other than a Covenant of Works, from which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath now Redeemed us, by his Blood and Sufferings for us.

               <p>MR. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> doth indeed alſo tell us in his forementioned Diſcourſe upon the Covenants, p. 174. <q>That that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which God made with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and under which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtood, was no Covenant of Works: But <hi>Moſes</hi> and the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were both under the ſame Covenant. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 27. <hi>I have made a Covenant with thee and with Iſrael.</hi> If any doubt under what Covenant <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtood, (whether of Works or Grace) let him peruſe <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 26.

And the Lord paſſed by before him, and Proclaimed, the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and Gracious, Long-ſuffering, and abundant in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and truth; keeping mercy for thouſands; forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin.</hi> Which was abſolutely and undeniably a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, which God then made and confirmed unto <hi>Moſes</hi> by Name, and unto all that were <hi>Elected</hi> among that People; (for it was not to <hi>all,</hi> ſince God expreſly tells <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>he would be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to whom he would be gracious, and would ſhew mercy to whom he would ſhew mercy.)</hi> And accordingly this was that that God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then lived upon, and were ſaved by: For if there had been no other Covenant made with them than that that was contained in the two Tables of Stone, it had been utterly impoſſible that either <hi>Moſes</hi> or any of the reſt could ever have been Saved. And this Goſpel Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial ſeems to have been purpoſely afforded unto <hi>Moſes</hi> and the reſt of the Faithful with him, for the Relief of their ſinking Spirits under the dread and terror of that <hi>Fiery Burning Law,</hi> Deut. 33, 2. <hi>The Lord came from Sinai, and roſe up from Seir unto them; he ſhined forth from Mount</hi> Paran; <hi>and he came with ten thouſands of Saints: From his right-hand went a Fier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Which diſcovery of Gods Infinite <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Juſtice and Righteouſneſs,</hi> proclaimed with ſo much Majeſty and Glory, attended with ſuch Thunderings, Blackneſs, Darkneſs and Tempeſt, was ſo dreadful and terrible, that <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly fears, and quakes at the Sight and Hearing thereof: And is accordingly taken Notice of and repreſented by the Apoſtle as a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating, or Diſtinguiſhing Character between that and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 18. &amp;c. <hi>You are not come</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to the Mount that might be touched, and that Burned with Fire, nor unto Blackneſs, and Darkneſs, and Tempeſt, and the ſound of a Trumpet, and the voice of Words; which Voice they that heard, intreated that the Word ſhould not be ſpoken to them any more. And ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was the Sight, that</hi> Moſes <hi>himſelf ſaid, I exceedingly fear and quake.

                  <hi>the Mediator of the New Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. From whence it is evident that there is an <hi>Eſſential</hi> difference between theſe two, the Law and the Goſpel; ſo as that what the one is, the other is not; the Law is not the Goſpel, nor the Goſpel the Law. You are not come (ſaith he) unto the Legal, but unto the Goſpel Covenant. The Legal Covenant diſcover'd nothing but Blackneſs, and Darkneſs and Tempeſt, and a <hi>voice of Words that could not be endured:</hi> For according to the Apoſtle's own preſent Deſcription or Character thereof, it made no diſcovery of the leaſt glimps of Goſpel Grace at all. The Legal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant therefore could not be a Covenant of Grace, or a Covenant of Faith, that made no diſcovery of any ſuch thing, but rather the contrary; ſo as that it makes <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf exceedingly Quake and Tremble.</p>
               <p>§. 3. However, it is certain that both <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all the Elect among that People of Old, were under the Covenant of Grace, as we have already ſaid, and by that were ſaved: And accordingly we are told, that <hi>they did all</hi> (that is, all the Elect among them) <hi>Eat the ſame ſpiritual Meat, and did all Drink the ſame ſpiritual Drink: For they Drank of that ſpiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Chriſt.</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 3. 4. And it is as Evident that it was no other than <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> that was the <hi>Angel of Gods preſence,</hi> that was to go before them and Conduct them in the way they were to go. But yet all this notwithſtanding, it is plain that the Law was a Covenant of Works ſtill; and it is alſo as Evident that it was a <hi>diſtinct</hi> Covenant, and <hi>Eſſentially different</hi> from the Covenant of Grace: And was accordingly made with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>whole Body of the Congregation,</hi> and not with <hi>Moſes</hi> and thoſe that were <hi>Elected</hi> among them only; as the Covenant of Grace was. And therefore Exod. 19. 5, 6.

This is the Subſtance of the Preface, and after Explication, that God himſelf makes, unto, and concerning the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which he now made with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even with the whole Body of that People; which was by the Finger of God himſelf Written and Ingraven in Stones: And is accordingly mentioned at large, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. In the ſeveral ten Branches, Commandments, or main Heads thereof.</p>
               <p>§ 4. In the next place, if we Enquire into the <hi>Nature</hi> of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: What ſort of Covenant it was? Whether a Covenant of Grace, or a Covenant of Works: As it is Evident that it could be no other than a Covenant of Works; ſince we ſee it required perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as the condition of obtaning the mercies therein promis'd; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the very Eſſence of that Covenant Conſiſted: So in order to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcovery of the true nature of the Covenant in queſtion, We muſt compare ſome paſſages in Exod. 34. with 2 Cor. 3. and Col. 2. 14. In Exod. 34. 1. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto Moſes, hew the two Tables of Stone like unto the firſt: And I will Write upon theſe Tables the words that were in the firſt Tables,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>And he hewed two Tables of Stone like unto the firſt: And Moſes went up unto the Mount Sinai, as the Lord Commanded him, and took in his hand the two Tables of Stone.</hi> ver. 28. <hi>And he was there with the Lord</hi> 40 <hi>days and</hi> 40 <hi>nights; and he Wrote upon the Tables, the words of the Covenant, the ten Commandments. And it came to paſs, when Moſes came down from Mount Sinai (with the two Tables of Teſtimony in Moſes's hand, when he came down from the Mount) that Moſes Wiſt not that the Skin of his Face ſhone, while he talked with him. And when</hi> Aaron <hi>and all the Children of Iſrael ſaw</hi> Moſes, <hi>behold the Skin of his Face ſhone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.</hi> If we will know therefore the true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Covenant, we ſhall find that the Spirit of God by the Apoſtle, doth give us a clear determination thereof in the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5, 6. <hi>Our Sufficiency</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is of God, who hath alſo made us able Miniſters of the New Teſtament; not of the Letter, but of the Spirit;</hi> (that is, not of the Law, but of the Goſpel) <hi>For the Letter Killeth, but the Spirit giveth Life. But</hi> (ſaith he, ver. 7.) <hi>If the Miniſtration of Death Written and Engraven in Stones was Glorious, ſo that the Children of Iſrael could not ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly behold the Face of Moſes for the Glory of his Countenance, which Glory was to be done away; how ſhall not the Miniſtration</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:50207:87"/> 
                  <hi>of the Spirit be rather Glorious.</hi> So again, ver. 9. <hi>If the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Condemnation be Glory, much more doth the Miniſtration of Righteouſneſs exceed in Glory.</hi> Wherein we cannot but obſerve, that the Apoſtle doth evidently Reflect upon the fore mentioned Paſſage in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28, 29, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where we are told, that <hi>Moſes</hi> Received from God the two Tables of Stone, wherein the words of the Covenant, even the Ten <hi>Commandments,</hi> were Written and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven by the Finger of God himſelf; and this Expreſly under the Denomination of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which God then made with <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 4. 13. Which made <hi>Moſes</hi> his Face to ſhine, ſo that <hi>Aaron</hi> and all the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were afraid to come nigh him. 'Tis clear then, that this is the <hi>Covenant</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> hear ſpeaks of. And what Character or Deſcription doth he give thereof? Why (ſaith he) The Law <hi>Written and Engraven in Stones,</hi> (how Glorious ſoever it was in it ſelf) was of a <hi>Killing Nature;</hi> it was the <hi>Miniſtration of Death and Condemnation;</hi> and that which was to be <hi>done away.</hi> To which ſame purpoſe, the ſame Apoſtle alſo tells us, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. That <hi>Chriſt hath Blotted out the Hand-writing of Ordinances that was againſt us, which was contrary to us, and hath took it out of the way, nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to his Croſs.</hi> Where the Apoſtle ſpeaks plainly of the ſame thing and to the ſame purpoſe, as he doth to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> for there he ſpeaks of the Law Written in Stones, which (ſaith he) was a Miniſtration of Death and Condemnation. And hereof the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of Ordinances that was againſt us, and contrary to us, (as the Law muſt needs be, if it was indeed no other than a Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Death and Condemnation, as the Apoſtle deſcribes it.) But is the Covenant of Faith of this Nature? Or was the Covenant of Grace a Miniſtration of Death and Condemnation, as the Apoſtle Affirms the Law written in Stones to be? Was the Covenant of Grace againſt us, Contrary to us, and therefore now Blotted out, done away, taken out of the way, and Nailed to the Croſs of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Hand-writing of Ordinances, or the Law written in Stones? Theſe are Sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ciſms too ſtrong for Digeſtion. It can never be imagined. And yet all this muſt needs follow, if the Law was a Covenant of Grace, as is Affirmed. 'Tis true, there was a Covenant of Grace that ran Current therewith, (as hath been before declared) whereby <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the Elect among that People, were delivered from the <hi>Curſe</hi> of that <hi>Fiery Burning Law,</hi> that was thus given them. But ſhall we therefore call the Miniſtration of Death, a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Grace? Or the miniſtration of Condemnation, a Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life and Righteouſneſs, which the Apoſtle doth ſo plainly ſet in Oppoſition thereunto? Or ſhall we ſay, that that which was againſt us, and contrary to us, was a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> or for the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of it ſuch? The Apoſtle (as we have already ſeen) tells us the quite
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50207:87"/> contrary. And ſo he doth <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9, 10. <hi>When the Commandment came</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Sin Revived, and I Died: And the Commandment which was Ordained to Life, I found to be unto Death.</hi> And how then can it be juſtly Affirmed, that the Law was a <hi>Covenant of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Grace,</hi> or that it was ſuch for the <hi>Subſtance</hi> thereof, when the Apoſtle found it by Experience to be a Miniſtration of Death.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Indeed the World Groans under the Burthen of ſuch Subtile Sophiſtical Diſtinctions, whereby the Truths of the Goſpel have been ſo long Obſcured, as they have been, and are, in reſpect of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Point; a Point of ſuch vaſt Conſequence and Concernment to the Church of God. For what can be of greater Moment than the <hi>Two Covenants;</hi> the Truths concerning which, are as the two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Veins that branch themſelves forth, and lye diſperſed up and down, throughout the whole Body of the Scriptures? If therefore it ſhall be found that we have been all this while Miſtaken in our Notion about the Covenants, what they are, and which they be; or that we have given the Appellation of the Covenant of Grace, to a Covenant of Works; and hereon have built up an Anſwerable Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure of Faith and Practice; how great will ſuch a Miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age prove to be at laſt? Indeed, there is no part of the Chriſtian Faith or Practice, but muſt one way or other have been Influenced and Corrupted thereby. Accordingly hence hath ſprung that <hi>Jumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> or <hi>Confounding</hi> of Law and Goſpel together, which the Spirit of God doth ſo <hi>Diſtinguiſhingly</hi> repreſent unto us in the Word of Truth; and which the Apoſtle doth ſo ſeverely Rebuke the Teachers among the <hi>Galatians,</hi> concerning. <hi>I Marvel</hi> (ſaith he, Gal. 1. 6, 7.) <hi>that ye are ſo ſoon removed from him that called you into the Grace of Chriſt, unto another Goſpel, which is, not another; but there be ſome that trouble you, and would Pervert the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> They would Pervert it, that is, they would change it, Overthrow it, and turn it upſide down; by mingling Law and Goſpel together; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto the Goſpel, and yet ſeek for Righteouſneſs, as it were by the Works of the Law. But certainly, as we are not <hi>to Seperate or put aſunder what God hath Conjoyned; ſo neither are we to mingle what God hath Separated, and doth plainly Diſtinguiſh.</hi> The Law is not the Goſpel; nor is the Goſpel the Law. Theſe two are diſtinct, and muſt be kept ſo; as having their Diſtinct Services, and in their proper Places. To call therefore the Covenant of Works a Covenant of Faith; or the Legal Covenant deliver'd on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace; is no other than to Blend or Confound Law and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel together, as if they were the ſame thing, and no diſtinſtion at all to be made betwixt them, only in reſpect of the different Degrees, or clearneſs of the Revelation of Goſpel Grace.</p>
               <p>§. 6. But whatever we may Imagine, the Apoſtle doth moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50207:88" rendition="simple:additions"/> diſtinguiſh betwixt Law and Goſpel, and that in Reſpect of the whole Entire Nature, Eſſence, or Subſiſtance of either. <hi>Tell me</hi> (ſaith he, Gal. 4. 21. &amp;c.) <hi>You that deſire to be under the Law, do ye not hear the Law?</hi> Know you not that <hi>Abraham</hi> had two Sons, the one by a Bondwoman, the other by Free; the one Born after the Fleſh, the other by Promiſe? And know you not that this was plainly Typical of the two Covenants, the Legal and the Goſpel? And that theſe two muſt needs be therefore Eſſentially Different, as much as Bondage is from Liberty: Or a Birth after the Fleſh, from that by promiſe? <hi>Tell me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>You that deſire to be under the Law, do ye not hear the Law?</hi> Doth not the Old Teſtament it ſelf ſpeak this Language to you? But whom doth the Apoſtle mean when he ſpeaks of them that <hi>deſire to be under the Law?</hi> 'Tis ſtrange that after, the Goſpel took place, any ſhould deſire to be under the Law; or that any ſhould be deſirous of returning to that old and former Yoke of Bondage, they had ſo long been Labouring under, and were now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from: To be under the Law is not to be under Grace: For theſe two are directly oppoſite. Rom. 6. 14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over you for ye are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> But yet nevertheleſs, it ſeems ſuch there were, even in the Apoſtle's time, who were deſirous <hi>to be under the Law:</hi> And 'tis as plain that ſuch there are now. But who are they? Why they are plainly thoſe that Affirm <hi>that the Law is a Covenant of Faith,</hi> or a <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> Thoſe muſt needs be of the Number of them that deſire to be under the Law. And how can it be otherwiſe? For ought we not to ſubmit our ſelves to a Covenant of Faith, and Subject our ſelves under the Power and Dominion of Goſpel Grace? If therefore we affirm that the Law is a Covenant of Faith, or a Covenant of Grace, we cannot be true to our own Principles, if we do not deſire to be under it, and under the Power and Dominion of it; and that not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a <hi>Rule of Life</hi> (which we all grant) but as <hi>a Covenant of Life,</hi> or as a <hi>Covenant of Faith and Grace,</hi> as it is affirmed to be. But if we are deſirous to be under the Law, (let our Notion thereof be what it will; that it is a Covenant of Works, or a Covenant of Grace) This is the direct and ready way for <hi>Chriſt to become of no Effect unto us.</hi> For (ſaith the Apoſtle, Gal. 5, 4.) <hi>Whoſoever of you are Juſtified by the Law, ye are fallen from Grace.</hi> And Conſequently, inſtead of being not under the Law, but under Grace, (as the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks of the believing <hi>Romans.)</hi> We are rather under the Law, and not under Grace. For theſe two are there (as well as in many other places beſides) plainly diſtinguiſhed as quite Oppoſite the one unto the other: So that if we are under the one, we are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the other. If we are under Grace, we are not under the Law; And if we are under the Law, we are not under Grace.</p>

               <p> §. 7. But, <hi>tell me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> in the forementioned, Gal. 4 21: &amp;c.) <hi>You that deſire to be under the Law; Do you not hear the Law? For it is Written, that</hi> Abraham <hi>had two Sons, the one by a Bond-Maid, the other by a Free-Woman. But he who was of the Bond-Woman, was born after the Fleſh: But he of the Free-Woman, by Promiſe. Which things are an Allegory: For theſe are the two Covenants; the one from Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>which gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth to Bondage, which is</hi> Agar: <hi>For this</hi> Agar <hi>is Mount</hi> Sinai <hi>in</hi> Arabia, <hi>and anſwereth to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>which now is, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For it is Written, Rejoyce thou barren that beareſt not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now we Brethren</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as</hi> Iſaac <hi>was, are the Children of the Promiſe.</hi> Wherein the Apoſtle doth make a plain Difference between the two Covenants, the Legal and the Goſpel, in the very <hi>Radical Nature,</hi> or <hi>Eſſence</hi> of either; Not in point of the <hi>Degrees</hi> of the Manifeſtation of <hi>Goſpel Grace</hi> (as is by many Divines ſuggeſted) For the Law Written in Stones diſcovers none at all. <hi>The Covenant from Mount</hi> Sinai (ſaith our Apoſtle.) <hi>gendereth to Bondage: For this</hi> Agar <hi>is Mount</hi> Sinai <hi>in</hi> Arabia, <hi>and is in Bondage with her Children.</hi> So that Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant is no other than a <hi>Bondage</hi> Covenant; it <hi>gendereth to Bondage;</hi> this is the natural ſcope, and tendency of it; and accordingly all <hi>her Children are in Bondage.</hi> And therefore, unleſs we ſhall ſay that the Covenant of Faith gendereth to Bondage; Or that the Covenant of Grace is a Bondage Covenant; And that all thoſe that are under it, or are the Children of it, are in Bondage; we can by no means allow that Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant was ever deſigned by God as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Faith, or as a Covenant of Grace, as by many Divines it is Confidently Affirmed to be. And therefore alſo, All thoſe that deſire to be under it (which cannot be avoided by thoſe that affirm it to be a Covenant of Faith) muſt of neceſſity (according to the Apoſtles Reckoning) be deſirous of Returning to that old Bondage which Chriſt hath deliver'd us from; and which the Apoſtle doth ſo earneſtly Exhort us to avoid, Gal. 5. 1. <hi>Stand faſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and be not Intangled again with the Yoke of Bondage.</hi>

Could not poſſibly be the Law Written in Stones; which will appear in a diligent Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words before and after Verſ. 3, 4.

               <p>§. 4. For firſt, It hath been already proved, That the Law Written in Stones had not been ſo much as received from God, when the Ceremonial Covenant was ſo Confirmed.

               <p> §. 5. It is therefore a great miſtake for any to affirm, that the Law written in Stones, was not a Covenant of Works, becauſe confirmed by Blood and Sprinkling; whereas, when it comes to be duly examined, there appears no ſuch matter: but inſtead of being proved thereby to be a Covenant of Grace, it is the more convincingly proved to be as it is indeed, no other than a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works. In which reſpect Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi>'s forementioned Argument may more juſtly and truly be thus formed.</p>
               <p>That Covenant that was not confirmed by the Blood of Chriſt (which alone can cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs) no, nor ſo much as by the Blood of Bulls, or Goats, or Calves, which was plainly typical thereof; could not poſſibly be a Covenant of Grace, but of Works: But the Law written in Stones, was ſo far from being confirmed by the Blood of Chriſt; that it was never (that we read of) confirmed by any other ſort of Blood whatſoever. Therefore that Covenant could not poſſibly be a Covenant of Grace but of Worlds.</p>
               <p>§. 6. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. ſpeaking of the Ceremonial Covenant, which was dedicated by Blood and Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; doth plainly repreſent it unto us under the denomination of <hi>the first Covenant that had a Worldly Sanctuary,</hi> verſ. 1. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to Chriſt, as the <hi>Figure</hi> to the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> verſ. 9. Calling the Statutes and Judgments therein contained by the name of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ordinances;</hi> and ſuch as <hi>could not make him that did the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice Perfect, as pertaining to the Conſcience,</hi> verſ. 10. <hi>Another Building,</hi> verſ. 11. And <hi>the First Teſtament,</hi> as it's Contradiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd from the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> and Chriſt the true and only Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice thereof, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18, 19. Beſides what he had told us in the 8th Chap. concerning this ſame Firſt, or Old-Teſtament; that it was of a <hi>faulty, decaying, vaniſhing nature,</hi> verſ. 7, 13. From all this it plainly appears, that even the <hi>Ceremonial Covenant</hi> it ſelf, could be no other than <hi>a Covenant of Works,</hi> as well as that writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Stones. And accordingly the Apoſtle informs us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. That <hi>as many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curſe: For it is written, Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</hi> Which Book of the Law, here ſpoken of, muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be the Book of the Covenant, written by <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Statutes and Judgments,</hi> or the Ceremonial Precepts, were contained. In reſpect whereof it is evident, that though the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and other things thereunto belonging, pointed at Chriſt,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50207:91"/> and the way of Salvation by him; yet ſuch was the ſeverity of the Divine Sanction thereunto annexed; that if thoſe under that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration had wrought never ſo hard, and kept themſelves in a Path of perfect and Univerſal Obedience to the multitude of thoſe Ceremonial Precepts all their days, (which was impoſſible;) yet if at laſt caſt there happened to be never ſo ſmall a tranſgreſſion, though in the leaſt Circumſtance, the Curſe of the Law preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took hold upon them, and that without mercy. For (as <hi>James</hi> ſaith) <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one Point, he is guilty of all:</hi> And accordingly the Curſe of the Law was pronounced upon <hi>every one that continued not in all things therein contained, to do them.</hi> This is the true Scope and Tenor even of the <hi>Ceremonial Covenant it ſelf,</hi> to all under it, that were not relieved by the Grace of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Wherefore, though it is plain, that the <hi>Law written in Stones,</hi> and the Book wherein the <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Judgments</hi> were contained; were two diſtinct Covenants, and delivered at diſtinct Seaſons, and in a diſtinct Method; the one with, the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Mediator; the one dedicated with Blood and Sprinkling, the other (that we read of) not ſo dedicated; yet it is as clear from the Premiſes, that they were both of the ſame <hi>Nature;</hi> that is, no other than <hi>a Covenant of Works,</hi> and accordingly both now Repealed, and that under the Denomination of the <hi>Firſt, or Old Covenant, which was of a decaying, vaniſhing nature,</hi> Heb. 8. <hi>ult.</hi> And accordingly, though the Blood of the Legal Sacrifices, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Ceremonial Covenant was dedicated, was plainly <hi>Typical</hi> of the Blood of Chriſt; yet foraſmuch as the Apoſtle informs us, <hi>it could not take away ſins, nor make the Comers thereunto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as pertaining to the Conſcience;</hi> Heb. 9. 9. Chap. 10. 1, 4. That Covenant therefore which was dedicated only by the Blood of ſuch Sacrifices, could never be a Covenant of Grace, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called (which hath Chriſt alone for the Mediator thereof, and was confirmed only by his Blood and Sufferings for us) but of Works.</p>
               <p>§. 8. Beſides, If the Ceremonial Covenant, which was thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by Blood and Sprinkling, had been indeed a Covenant of Grace, and confirmed alſo by the Blood of Chriſt; why ſhould it be <hi>Repealed,</hi> as we know it was (as well as the Law written in Stones, which is ſaid to be now <hi>done away?)</hi> Is it poſſible that a Covenant of Grace, confirmed by the Blood of Chriſt, ſhould ever be <hi>Repealed?</hi> Or why did God appoint the New Covenant
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50207:92"/> to ſucceed it, which was <hi>Really ſo Confirmed,</hi> and which is alſo oppoſed thereunto as <hi>another</hi> Covenant, and of a quite different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Unleſs we ſhall ſay, that there were two Covenants of Grace Confirmed by the Blood of Chriſt; the one whereof was of <hi>a faulty, accaying, vaniſhing Nature,</hi> as the Firſt Covenant is by the Spirit of God himſelf deſcribed; which to affirm, would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to Contradict the whole Scope of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>§. 9. The Blood of thoſe Sacrifices therefore, wherewith the Ceremonial Covenant was dedicated, together with the reſt of the Types that were then afforded, ſerved only as an <hi>Example, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and Shadow of Heavenly things.</hi> They were not (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>The Heavenly things themſelves,</hi> Heb. 9. 23. <hi>For the Law</hi> (ſaith he, Heb. 10. 1, <hi>&amp;c.) having a ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very Image of the things, can never with thoſe Sacrifices which they offered year by year; continually, make the Commers thereunto perfect: For then they ſhould not have ceaſed to be Offered, becauſe that the Worſhippers once purged, ſhould have had no more Conſcience of Sins. But in theſe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, there is a remembrance again made of Sins every year: For it is not poſſible that the Blood of Bulls and of Goats ſhould take away Sins.</hi> All thoſe Sacrifices therefore; could never amount to the value of the Blood of Chriſt. And accordingly, that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, though dedicated by Blood and Sprinkling, was no other than <hi>a Covenant of Works,</hi> for as much as it was not confirmed by the Blood of Chriſt: For if it had, it would have <hi>made the Commers thereunto Perfect, as pertaining to the Conſcience;</hi> which it did not.</p>
               <p>§. 10. Beſides, the Apoſtle expreſly tells us, That <hi>Chriſt hath obtained a more Excellent Miniſtry,</hi> than that of <hi>Moſes; by how much alſo he is the Mediator of a Better Covenant, which was Eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes,</hi> Heb. 8. 6. Which <hi>Better Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> the Apoſtle doth plainly oppoſe unto <hi>the Firſt,</hi> or <hi>Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> verſ. 7, 8, 9, 13. From whence it plainly follows, that Chriſt was not the Mediator of the Firſt, or Old Covenant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we ſhall ſay, that he was the Mediator of two Covenants, a Better and a Worſe: And conſequently it doth as plainly follow, that the Firſt Covenant was no other than a Covenant of Works, ſince neither was Chriſt the Mediator of it; nor did he ever ſhed his Blood for the Confirmation thereof.</p>

               <p>HAving thus far conſidered Mr. <hi>Obadiah Sedgwick's</hi> Arguments, wherewith he labours to prove that the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant was not a Covenant of Works, but of Grace: We ſhould next have conſidered Mr. <hi>Francis Roberts</hi> his Arguments alſo to the ſame purpoſe, in his large Diſcourſe upon the Covenants; But that the moſt ſubſtantial part of them have been already diſpatcht in the Anſwers we have returned to Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi>'s Arguments. Onely we cannot but take notice of two grand Abſurdities which Mr. <hi>Roberts,</hi> and all others who Aſſert that <hi>the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant was a Covenant of Faith,</hi> do, and cannot but unavoidably run into, and faſten upon the Scriptures, on that Hypotheſis. The firſt is this; Whereas Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> pretending to Anſwer ſeveral Objections which are urged by way of oppoſition to his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Doctrine, the Fourth Objection which he mentions, <hi>pag.</hi> 769. of his forementioned Diſcourſe; runs thus;</p>
               <p>§. 2. <hi>Object.</hi> 4. <q>The <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant is oppoſed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> to the New Covenant, and is ſaid to be broken by the People of <hi>Iſrael, Jer.</hi> 31. 31, 32, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8, 9, 10. Therefore it is not a Covenant of Faith, which is everlaſting and cannot be broken; But a Covenant of works, which is but Temporary and liable to be broken.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is indeed a ſubſtantial Argument or Objection againſt, what he Aſſerts; But how ſubſtantially anſwered may appear by what follows: For thus he returns thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Theſe Premiſes (ſaith he) will not bear this Concluſion, for firſt, though the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant made with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when God brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>unlike,</hi> or <hi>not according to the New Covenant;</hi> yet it is not ſaid either by the Prophet or Apoſtle, to be <hi>unlike to the Covenant of Faith.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>Reply.</hi> But what a ſtrange Evaſion is this? And whither will not Men run when left to themſelves? For is not the New Covenant a Covenant of Faith? And therefore when the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant is oppoſed to the New Covenant; is it not plainly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Covenant of Faith? Or ſhall we make the New-Covenant, and the Covenant of Faith oppoſite, and Contradiſtinct the one from the other, as Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> plainly doth; when he
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50207:93"/> ſaith, that though the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant is oppoſed to the New Covenant; yet it is not oppoſed to the Covenant of Faith: As if the New Covenant and the Covenant of Faith, were not one and the ſame thing? But certainly the New Covenant, to which the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant is oppoſed, muſt needs be a Covenant of Faith, or there is no Covenant of Faith mentioned in the Scriptures; And conſequently ſince the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant is both by the Prophet and Apoſtle, ſo plainly oppoſed to the New Covenant, from hence it plainly follows, that it was never deſigned by God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Faith: For elſe why is it oppoſed thereunto?</p>
               <p>§. 4. <q>But (ſaith Mr. <hi>Roberts)</hi> the Diſſmilitude or Difference here Intimated betwixt the <hi>Sinai Covenant</hi> and <hi>the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> is not in <hi>ſubſtance or kind:</hi> For in both the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People;</hi> But onely in the <hi>manner of Adminiſtration</hi> or <hi>Degree:</hi> God promiſing in the <hi>New Covenant</hi> a greater, fuller, and clearer Meaſure of Grace unto his People, than under the <hi>Sinai Covenant.</hi>
                  </q> Whereof he gives Three Inſtances, in point of Sanctification, Illumination, and Remiſſion. And then Concludes; <q>Thus (ſaith he) the <hi>Sinai Covenant, gradually,</hi> not <hi>ſpecifically,</hi> differs from the <hi>New Covenant.</hi> They are both <hi>Covenants of Faith:</hi> But the <hi>New Covenant</hi> every way more Excellent, Compleat, and Perfect.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. To this we reply, That as the Diſſimilitude or Difference here Intimated betwixt the <hi>Sinai Covenant</hi> and the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not in <hi>Subſtance;</hi> Since in both the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People:</hi> So neither in the <hi>manner of Adminiſtration;</hi> that is, If by the manner of Adminiſtration, we underſtand the <hi>Meaſure</hi> or <hi>Degrees</hi> of the Divine Bleſſedneſs therein Promiſed. For what can be a greater, or more Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Bleſſedneſs, than for <hi>God to be their God,</hi> and <hi>they to be his People?</hi> For this Comprehends Juſtification, Sanctification and Illumination, in the heighth and Perfection of them. And indeed what is not promiſed where God is promiſed? And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly this is the Bleſſedneſs promiſed in both Covenants. The Difference or Diſſimilitude, therefore, betwixt the <hi>Sinai Covenant</hi> and the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> upon the Account whereof they are here oppoſed the one unto the other, muſt of neceſſity Conſiſt in the <hi>terms of either,</hi> and in that alone. <hi>For</hi> Moſes (ſaith the Apoſtle Rom. 10. 5.) <hi>deſcribeth the Righteouſneſs of the Law, that the Man which doth theſe things ſhall live by them.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Life and happineſs is promiſed in the Goſpel Covenant in <hi>the</hi>

                  <hi>way of believing onely,</hi> from <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. to 12. And indeed nothing ſhort of this can be duely ſuppoſed as the ground of ſuch an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition as here Inſiſted on: For can it be rationally imagined, that a bare difference in the <hi>Extent or Degrees</hi> of the Divine Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs promiſed in either, could be a ſufficient ground for the Prophet or Apoſtle to ſpeak as they do, that the <hi>New Covenant</hi> was <hi>not like,</hi> or <hi>not according to the</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant?</hi> For if the <hi>Subſtance</hi> be the ſame, there is ſtill a <hi>likeneſs</hi> between them, though in Reſpect of <hi>Degrees</hi> Circumſtantially <hi>different.</hi> A Child hath the <hi>likeneſs</hi> of a Man, though not grown up to a <hi>Perfect Stature.</hi> But if the Difference or Diſſimilitude lie in the <hi>terms</hi> of either, and thoſe terms <hi>Eſſentially</hi> different; Then, though the Promiſes are the ſame for the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of them, and the <hi>Degrees</hi> of the Mercy promiſed alſo; yet it may be juſtly and properly ſaid, that the one is <hi>not like,</hi> or <hi>not according</hi> to the other: For as <hi>Covenants,</hi> they are <hi>Eſſentially</hi> different, becauſe the <hi>terms</hi> are ſo. And accordingly it is evident, both from the forementioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo from <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. Where the <hi>Sinai Covenant,</hi> is oppoſed to the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> that whereas the Promiſes of the <hi>Sinai Covenant</hi> run all upon <hi>condition of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and Perfect Obedience</hi> to whatſoever the Law requireth; the Promiſes of the <hi>New Covenant</hi> are all of them <hi>Abſolute,</hi> and therefore onely to be <hi>received by Faith:</hi> For as therein God promiſeth that <hi>he will put his Laws in their Mind, and write them in their Hearts:</hi> So he doth alſo freely Promiſe, <hi>that he will be Merciful to their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, and their Sins and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities will he remember no more.</hi> All which promiſes of Grace were plainly wanting in the <hi>Sinai Covenant:</hi> For that required <hi>Obedience,</hi> as the <hi>Condition</hi> of Life, but gave no <hi>ſtrength</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it; And not onely ſo, but pronounced a dreadful <hi>Curſe upon every Tranſgreſſion and Diſobedience,</hi> leaving no room for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. So that it is plain that the <hi>Sinai Covenant</hi> and the <hi>New Covenant</hi> differ <hi>Specifically;</hi> the One being a Covenant of <hi>Faith,</hi> the Other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of <hi>Works.</hi> And on this Account onely are they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the one unto the other both by <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Jeremy.</hi> In which Reſpect, though the Promiſes in both are the ſame, for <hi>Subſtance; I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People:</hi> As alſo in reſpect of the <hi>Degrees</hi> of the Divine Bleſſedneſs promiſed in either; yet the <hi>terms</hi> of Enjoyment being <hi>Eſſentially</hi> different, hence it plainly follows, that ſo are the Covenants themſelves, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p> §. 6. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas 'tis juſtly urged, That ſince the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant is ſaid to be broken by the people of <hi>Iſrael, Jer.</hi> 31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. Therefore it is not a Covenant of Faith, which is Everlaſting and cannot be broken; but a Covenant of Works, which is but temporary and liable to be broken. To this Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> returns thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Though (ſaith he) <hi>Iſrael</hi> brake the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant by their Idolatry; yet they brake it not utterly and Irreparably, as <hi>Adam</hi> brake the Covenant of Works by his firſt Tranſgreſſion: For God admitted them to Repentance; upon their Repentance Pardons them; and renews the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant again with them. Therefore this Breach of Covenant doth no way prove the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant to be a Covenant of Works, not of Faith; Temporary, not Everlaſting.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 7. <hi>Reply.</hi> But why ſhould any part of the truth of God be concealed, which was ſo neceſſary here to have been diſcovered? For though the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant was renewed in the Second Tables, after the firſt were broken, upon the Idolatry of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> about the Golden Calf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. Yet it clearly appears, and we cannot be Ignorant, that afterward it was utterly broken, and they Rejected, as they are to this Day. Elſe why doth God ſay, <hi>which my Covenant they brake, they continued not in it, and I regarded them not, Jer.</hi> 31. 32. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 9. which plainly looks further than the <hi>firſt Breach:</hi> For it is clear that after the firſt Breach <hi>they were regarded by God,</hi> ſince upon <hi>Moſes</hi> his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion they were admitted to Repentance; and it is evident that upon their Repentance the Lord Pardons them, and Renews the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant again with them. But it is as Evident, that at length having broken it again and again, God plainly tells them that <hi>he Regarded them not.</hi> So that though tis true, the <hi>firſt Breach</hi> doth no way prove the <hi>Sinai Covenant</hi> to be a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Works,</hi> not of <hi>Faith;</hi> Temporary, not Everlaſting; yet the <hi>after Breaches do.</hi> Elſe why doth the Apoſtle tell us as he doth, concerning the ſame <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, that it is diſ-annulled, Heb. 7. 18 <hi>For there is verily a diſ-annulling of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment going before, for the weakneſs and unprofitableneſs thereof.</hi> So likewiſe, Heb. 8. 7. <hi>For if that firſt Covenant had been faultleſs, there ſhould no place have been ſought for the ſecond.</hi> And Verſ. 13. <hi>In that he ſaith a New Covenant, he hath made the firſt Old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old, is ready to vaniſh away.</hi> Though the <hi>Sinai Covenant</hi> therefore was <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:50207:94"/> after the <hi>firſt Breach</hi> thereof; yet the Scriptures do give us a Poſitive Aſſurance, that at length it was <hi>utterly</hi> and <hi>irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably broken;</hi> And ſo broken, that at laſt it was <hi>diſ-annulled,</hi> made to <hi>Expire,</hi> and <hi>vaniſh away,</hi> which is utterly Inconſiſtent with the Nature of the <hi>Covenant of Faith,</hi> according to the whole Scope and Tenour of the Scriptures. So that we ſee that without a Manifeſt and Palpable Abſurdity, there is no Reſiſting the force and Evidence of the forementioned Objection. The Concluſion whence Reſulting, is therefore highly Rational, and remains firm and unſhaken. That ſince the <hi>Sinai Covenant</hi> is both by the Prophet and Apoſtle plainly oppoſed to the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and is ſaid to be <hi>broken,</hi> and ſo broken as to Expire and <hi>vaniſh away;</hi> Therefore it is not a <hi>Covenant of Faith,</hi> which is <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting</hi> and cannot be broken; but a <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> that was but <hi>Temporary,</hi> and liable thereunto.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>unchangeable</hi> nature of the Covenant of Faith, at leaſt on <hi>Gods part,</hi> whatever it is on <hi>ours;</hi> beſides a multitude of other Teſtimonies that might be produced. the 89. <hi>Pſalm</hi> gives us a clear and convincing Evidence thereof, Verſ. 30. &amp;c. <hi>If his Children forſake my Law, and walk not in my Judgments; if they break my Statutes, and keep not my Commandments; Then will I Viſit their Tranſgreſſion with the Rod, and their Iniquity with Stripes; Nevertheleſs my Loving kindneſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail; My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my Lips. Once have I Sworn by my Holineſs that I will not lie unto</hi> David, <hi>his Seed ſhall endure for ever, and his Throne as the Sun before me. It ſhall be Eſtabliſhed for ever as the Moon, and as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Witneſs in Heaven.</hi> The like Aſſurance we have concerning the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham. Wherein</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17, 18.) <hi>God willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the Heirs of Promiſe the Immutability of his Counſel, Confirmed it by an Oath, that by two Immutable things in which it was Impoſſible for God to lie, we might have ſtrong Conſolation,</hi> &amp;c. So that we ſee, the <hi>Covenant of Faith,</hi> or which is all one, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, is every way perfect, unchangeable, unrepealable, and Everlaſting. Whereas the <hi>Sinai Covenant,</hi> was of a <hi>faulty, decaying, vaniſhing Nature,</hi> and accordingly was at laſt <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annulled;</hi> and therefore could not poſſibly be any other than a <hi>Covenant of Works.</hi>

               <p>§. 8. The Second Abſurdity is this. Whereas Mr. <hi>Roberts, pag.</hi> 772. of his forementioned Diſcourſe, pretending to Anſwer
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50207:95"/> the Seventh Objection againſt his Aſſertion; the Objection it ſelf as himſelf ſtates it, runs thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 7. <q>The Condition upon which Life and Happineſs is held forth in the Law, or <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, is Perfect Doing: <hi>For Moſes deſcribeth the Righteouſneſs which is of the Law; that the man which doth theſe things, ſhall live by them,</hi> Rom. 10. 3. with Lev. 18. 5. Gal. 3. 12. And he denounceth a Curſe upon the leaſt failing; <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law, to do them,</hi> Deut. 27. 26. Gal. 3. 10. But the Condition upon which Life and Happineſs is tendred in the Covenant of Faith, is <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 10. 6. to 12. Doing, and Believing; Works, and Faith; are two Contrary Conditions of Life: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently; the Law, or <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, which requires Doing unto Life, cannot be a Covenant of Faith; but muſt needs be a Covenant of Works.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Anſwer which Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> returns unto this Strong and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Objection; firſt of all in general runs thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This Objection (ſaith he) as it is moſt Obvious to every one, that reads the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Galatians;</hi> ſo it is in my judgment, of greateſt difficulty to be clearly and ſatisfactorily <hi>Anſwered.</hi> And yet it is of great Conſequence and Neceſſity to be Cleared; becauſe otherwiſe, the true Nature and Intent of this <hi>Sinai Covenant,</hi> as a <hi>Covenant of Faith in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> will not be fully and ſufficiently evidenced. Several <hi>Anſwers</hi> are given.

               </p>
               <p>§. 9. <hi>Reply.</hi> But if ever there was an Abſurdity, or plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction impoſed upon the Scriptures; we think we may juſtly and truly ſay, that here it is. For though 'tis true, there are thoſe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50207:95"/> that labour to faſten an abſurdity upon ſuch as affirm that Gods People of old were under two Contrary Covenants, at one and the ſame time; yet was it ever known, that <hi>the ſame Fountain did at the ſame time ſend forth Bitter Waters and Sweet?</hi> Or can it ever be rationally imagined, that the <hi>ſame Sinai Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> was purpoſely ſo diſpenſed, as to tence life and happineſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two <hi>Oppoſite</hi> and <hi>Contrary Conditions?</hi> For though 'tis true, two Oppoſite Covenants may be allowed to be purpoſely ſo diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as to tender Life and Happineſs upon two Oppoſite and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Conditions, <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Faith;</hi> yet it is utterly impoſſible that the ſame Covenant ſhould be ſo diſpenſed. For as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle reaſoneth concerning Election, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. So it is here; <hi>If by Grace, then it is no more of Works; otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace. But if it be of Works, then it is no more Grace; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Work is no more Work.</hi> So that we ſee, according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles reckoning, it is utterly impoſſible that two Oppoſite and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Conditions, ſhould be able to conſiſt together in one and the ſame Covenant. Either the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant therefore is a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, or it is a Covenant of Works. If it is a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> then according to the ſcope of the Apoſtles Reaſoning, <hi>it is no more of Works.</hi> And if ſo, whence is it that <hi>Works</hi> are ſo plainly required, as the <hi>Condition</hi> of obtaining the mercies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in promiſed, and which the forementioned Objection doth give ſuch a full demonſtration concerning; that it ſhines with a clear and convincing Evidence in the faces of thoſe that aſſert it, to be a Covenant of Grace? If therefore it be, as indeed it is, a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works,</hi> and purpoſely ſo diſpenſed, as to tender Life and Happineſs upon <hi>Condition of Doing</hi> (which Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> himſelf grants) How comes it to be a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> ſince the Apoſtle aſſures us, that <hi>if it be of Works, then it is no more Grace; otherwiſe Work is no more Work?</hi> So that we ſee the Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of no ſuch <hi>Mixture;</hi> and ſhews us, 'tis impoſſible that the ſame Covenant ſhould be ſo diſpenſed, as to tender Life and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs upon two ſuch Oppoſite and Contrary Conditions, as <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Works.</hi> And yet this <hi>Abſurdity,</hi> all thoſe muſt of neceſſity run into, that affirm the <hi>Sinai Covenant,</hi> to be a <hi>Covenant of Faith:</hi> Since it is evident and cannot be denied, but that Life and Happineſs are therein frequently and plainly tendred upon <hi>Condition of Doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 10. <q>But (ſaith Mr. <hi>Roberts)</hi> in this <hi>Sinai Covenant</hi> thoſe Oppoſite Conditions of <hi>Perfect Doing,</hi> under pain of Curſe and Death; and of <hi>Believing in Christ,</hi> are very differently Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50207:96"/> and Revealed. <hi>Believing in Chriſt</hi> is revealed very Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly and Obſcurely. <hi>Perfect Doing,</hi> very frequently and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (that by the way is well granted.) But (ſaith he) though theſe two Conditions of <hi>Perfect Doing,</hi> and <hi>Believing,</hi> he thus differently Revealed and Required in the <hi>Sinai Covenant;</hi> yet <hi>Believing in Chriſt</hi> unto Life and Reighteouſneſs, was therein chiefly and ultimately intended; and <hi>Perfect Doing</hi> only urged in ſubordination and tendency to <hi>Believing.</hi> And that <hi>Believing in Chriſt unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> is chiefly and ultimately intended in the <hi>Sinai Covenant,</hi> is plain from <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, drawing the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Faith</hi> from <hi>that</hi> Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 11, to 15. Compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, to 11.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 11. <hi>Reply.</hi> But if <hi>Believing in Chriſt unto Life and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> was chiefly and ultimately intended in the <hi>Sinai Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> and <hi>Perfect Doing,</hi> only urged in ſubordination and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie to <hi>Believing:</hi> How comes it to paſs that the Apoſtle doth ſo directly <hi>oppoſe</hi> the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of that Covenant to the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith,</hi> in the forementioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5, 6. <hi>For</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (ſaith he) <hi>deſcribeth the Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, that the man which doth theſe things, ſhall live by them. But the Righteouſneſs which is of Faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe,</hi> &amp;c. in a quite different ſtrain and ſtile. Wherein when he tells us, that the Law ſaith, <hi>Do this and Live:</hi> How can it be underſtood, but that his Meaning is, that this is the <hi>Only</hi> Righteouſneſs which the Law requireth, in order to Life and Salvation: Or this is that which it <hi>ultimately</hi> intends, and <hi>no other way</hi> doth it propound in order thereunto: For otherwiſe we cannot rationally underſtand him; eſpecially, ſince he doth elſewhere aſſure us, that <hi>the Law is not of Faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 12. The Objection againſt which, from <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (from whence it is inferred, that the <hi>Law</hi> requireth Faith in Chriſt, in order to Life and Righteouſneſs, as well as the <hi>Goſpel)</hi> hath been already Anſwered in the foregoing parts of this Diſcourſe; where it hath been plainly proved, that the 30th of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> is taken up with the Deſcription (not of the Covenant at <hi>Sinai,</hi> but) of that New and <hi>Evangelical</hi> Covenant, that God intended to Eſtabliſh with <hi>Iſrael in after-times;</hi> and is accordingly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as a <hi>quite different</hi> Covenant from that at <hi>Sinai,</hi> as plainly appears by the manner of <hi>Paul</hi>'s allegation thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6. And that chiefly, for as much as it required <hi>faith in Chriſt,</hi> in order to Life and Righteouſneſs, as the Apoſtle there interprets it. Whereas the <hi>Sinai Covenant</hi> (as both <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50207:96"/> deſcribes it) inſiſts on <hi>Works onely;</hi> that <hi>the Man which doth theſe things ſhall live by them,</hi> And to ſay, that theſe two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Conditions may be Required in one and the ſame <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant; is plainly to Contradict the Apoſtle, who in his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation thereof, ſets the Righteouſneſs of the Law, and the Righteouſneſs of Faith in direct Oppoſition the one unto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Inconſiſtent in one and the ſame Covenant. <hi>Moſes</hi> (ſaith be) <hi>deſcribeth the Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, that the Man which doth theſe things ſhall live by them: But the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is of Faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If thou ſhalt believe thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Whereby he would have us plainly to underſtand that theſe are two <hi>oppoſite Covenants;</hi> Whereas had it been his meaning, that the Law or <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant was purpoſely ſo diſpenſed as to tender Life and Happineſs upon two ſuch <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite</hi> and <hi>contrary Conditions,</hi> he would not have ſaid that the Law requireth <hi>one thing;</hi> and the Righteouſneſs of Faith, <hi>another:</hi> But that the Law requireth <hi>both.</hi> And therefore it muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of two <hi>contrary Covenants,</hi> requiring two oppoſite Conditions; It being indeed Impoſſible; that one and the ſame Covenant ſhould be ſo diſpenſed.</p>
               <p>§. 12. And here by the way it may be obſerved, that though Mr. <hi>Baxter:</hi> (as hath been already noted in the foregoing part of this Diſcourſe) ſeems plainly to grant, that the Law or <hi>Sinai Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> was no other then a <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> requiring perfect Obedience as the Condition of Life, unto which <hi>the Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> or the Goſpel Covenant is oppoſed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5, 6. Which Goſpel Covenant he ſuppoſeth to be inſiſted on, both in the <hi>29th</hi> and <hi>30th</hi> Chapters of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and that from both, the Apoſtle draws that Deſcription of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith he ſpeaketh of, making no difference between the Covenants or Promiſes mentioned in thoſe two Chapters. Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> on the other hand we ſee; makes the <hi>Sinai Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant of Faith</hi> to be all one <q>For (ſaith he) that believing in Chriſt unto Righteouſneſs is chiefly and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately intended in the <hi>Sinai Covenant,</hi> is plain from <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, drawing the Righteouſneſs of Faith from that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 11, to 15. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, to 11.</q> So that in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s Reſpect, Mr. <hi>Roberts,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> moſt of neceſſity be out of the way, either the one or the other, or both of them. For to ſay as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth, that though the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith is by the Apoſtle oppoſed unto the Law or <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant; yet not unto the Covenant mentioned; <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50207:97"/> reckoning that in the <hi>30th</hi> Chapter to be all one with that in the <hi>29th</hi> is widely different from the Truth; Since it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready plainly proved, that the Covenant mentioned; <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. is of the ſame Stamp and Tenour with the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, and that both are Eſſentially different from the Covenant of Faith mentioned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. And again, on the other hand, to ſay as Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> doth, that the <hi>Sinai Covenant</hi> is a Covenant of Faith, and that <hi>Moſes</hi> draws the Righteouſneſs of Faith from that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, would be plainly to contradict Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and not onely ſo, but would be point blank to contradict the Interpretation given thereof by <hi>Paul himſelf</hi> in the forementioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5, 6. where he doth clearly oppoſe the Righteouſneſs of Faith to the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant.</p>
               <p>§. 13. Indeed the Principal ground of Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> his miſtake, or that which he ſeems to lay the greateſt ſtreſs upon, when he affirms the <hi>Sinai Covenant</hi> to be a <hi>Covenant of Faith,</hi> is this; becauſe the Deſcription that <hi>Paul</hi> gives of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is drawn from the Deſcription that <hi>Moſes</hi> gives thereof in the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> as if becauſe the Law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Deſcription he there gives of <hi>the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith</hi> muſt needs be underſtood of the <hi>Sinai Covenant;</hi> whereas it is Evident that <hi>Paul</hi> was of another Mind: For he makes the Deſcription that <hi>Moſes</hi> gives there of the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> to be quite oppoſite to the Deſcription that <hi>Moſes</hi> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where gives of the <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Sinai Covenant. Moſes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>deſcribeth the Righteouſneſs of the Law, that the Man which doth theſe things ſhall live by them;</hi> which he cites from <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 9. Whereas <hi>the Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> or the Goſpel Covenant ſpeaketh after quite another ſort; <hi>That if thou ſhalt believe, thou ſhalt be ſaved;</hi> which he quotes from <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. From whence, what can be more Evident, than that he brings in <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribing two <hi>Oppoſite</hi> and <hi>Eſſentially different Covenants</hi> in reſpect of the terms of Life propounded in either? Beſides, though the Law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> whereof he was the alone and onely <hi>Mediator;</hi> yet it is evident, that even <hi>Moſes himſelf</hi> doth give ſufficient notice of <hi>another Covenant,</hi> that was to take place in <hi>after times;</hi> and that not onely in the forementioned <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> but in the <hi>18th</hi> Chapter, which is alſo noted by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 3. 22. Moſes <hi>truly ſaid unto the Fathers, a Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, like unto me; him ſhall yea hear in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you. Moſes</hi> therefore gives them ſufficient notice
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50207:97"/> of <hi>another Covenant,</hi> and not onely ſo, but of <hi>another Prophet</hi> alſo that God would raiſe up unto them to be the <hi>Mediator</hi> thereof. And that this <hi>other Prophet</hi> was to be the Mediator of <hi>another Covenant,</hi> is plain from what the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>But now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath he obtained a more Excellent Miniſtry</hi> (to wit, than that of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpoken of in the foregoing Verſe) <hi>by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>§. 14. So that it is Evident, that the Covenant made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> at <hi>Mount Sinai, Exod.</hi> 19. and 20: which was afterward renewed with them in the Land of <hi>Moab, Deut.</hi> 29. is <hi>another</hi> Covenant and <hi>Eſſentially</hi> different from the <hi>Covenant of Faith,</hi> or the Goſpel Covenant mentioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that not onely ſince the <hi>Terms are Eſſentially different,</hi> but ſince it hath alſo <hi>another and far different Mediator.</hi> Wherefore the forementioned Objection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithſtanding, the Apoſtles Teſtimony, remains firm and cannot be Evaded; That <hi>the Law is not of Faith.</hi> And accordingly whatever Subordination or Tendency the Law hath to drive us to the Covenant of Faith for Relief and Shelter, to be ſure the Law it ſelf gives us no Relief: For neither chiefly nor Ultimately doth it <hi>propound Faith</hi> as the <hi>Condition</hi> of Life, but <hi>Doing</hi> onely; and conſequently is <hi>another Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Eſſentially</hi> different from the <hi>Covenant of Faith</hi> to which it drives us. <hi>The Law</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) requireth Doing unto Life.</hi> The <hi>Goſpel</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) requireth Faith.

Now whom ſhall we believe?

               <p>BUT whereas we have Aſſerted that the Covenant which God made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> was as much a Covenant of Works as that made with our firſt Parent.

Life and Salvation was not then its end; that is, in it ſelf, it neither was, nor could be given after the Fall for ſuch a deſign and purpoſe.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> much a <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> as that made with our firſt Parent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For God never <hi>intended</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf ſhould obtain Life
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50207:98"/> and Righteouſneſs by his Obedience to that Covenant: For if he had, the purpoſe or <hi>intention</hi> of God in that reſpect, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity have been accompliſhed: And accordingly <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have ſtood, and Life and Righteouſneſs ſhould that way have been derived unto him; and not only unto him, but unto all his Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring alſo. But it is evident, that <hi>Man that was in Honour, abode not,</hi> but fell, and we all in him; and accordingly a New Covenant takes place, whereby Life and Righteouſneſs was to be derived, both unto him, and all his Elect Offspring.</p>
               <p>§. 3. So that if that Covenant at <hi>Sinai</hi> was materially a Cove-of Works, though God intended not, that Life ſhould be that way derived unto us; ſo it was in reſpect of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant alſo. For as in the Legal Covenant, God doth now plainly tell ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>That the Man that doth theſe things, ſhall live by them:</hi> that is, if you can perform a ſteady, perfect Obedience, Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſhall be your Reward; thus, and no otherwiſe was our firſt Parent himſelf dealt withal. For this was all the ſtipulation, or agreement that we find God made with him: Gen. 2. 16. <hi>The Lord God commanded the man, ſaying; of every Tree of the Garden, thou maist freely eat: But of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, thou ſhalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> Carrying with it an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite, <hi>conditional</hi> Promiſe; that if he forbore it, both Himſelf, and Poſterity ſhould live. For God, never, that we can find, made any <hi>abſolute</hi> Promiſe of Life to him; only implicit, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional.</hi> And ſince it cannot, with any ſhadow of truth, be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that God ever made any <hi>abſolute Promiſe</hi> of this nature unto him: Neither therefore can it be juſtly affirmed, that God ever <hi>intended,</hi> that Life and Righteouſneſs ſhould be conveyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by his Obedience unto that Covenant. Nay, rather it is clear, that God foreſaw he would fall; and conſequently <hi>deſigned</hi> that Life and Righteouſneſs <hi>ſhould not</hi> that way be derived unto HIm, or to any of his Offspring. From whence it plainly follows, the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, was as much a Covenant of Works, as that made with our firſt Parent; not only ſince it is materially the ſaine, but in this reſpect, intentionally alſo.</p>

               <p>BUt whereas it is further objected; <q>That if God never ſince the Fall publiſhed the Covenant of Works with a deſign to juſtifie any man by it; and yet in the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant hath given it (materially Conſidered) a Second Edition, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation: It muſt needs follow, that it was done in <hi>Subſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> to Chriſt, and the Covenant of Grace; or done in vain, as to the Elect. To ſet it forth in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the Covenant of Grace, can never be imagined. To make it a <hi>Co-ordinate</hi> way of Salvation with Chriſt, is proved impoſſible. Therefore it muſt be <hi>ſubordinate,</hi> or not at all; there being nothing elſe left us. And this, (ſay they) the Scriptures fully aſſert and confirm; Rom. 10. 4. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs, to every one that believeth.</hi> Are the End and Means contrariant? Or muſt not the means be always ſubordinate to the end? This is plain and clear Reaſoning, not eaſily Anſwered. So Gal. 3. 24. <hi>The Law it as our School-maſter</hi> to bring us to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> that is, to bring us to a Conviction of his Neceſſity; as it did <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. after Chriſt was come, and thouſands more ſince <hi>Paul.</hi> Again, Gal. 3. 23. <hi>It ſhut us up</hi> to Chriſt, or Faith, as our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Remedy. This was, and ſtill is its uſe and deſign, and will be ſo to the end, to all that come to Chriſt. As to others it hath another end; even to Judge and Condemn them that continue under it, as a Covenant of Works; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 12. But to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, it is ſubſervient to Chriſt; both to bring them to him at firſt, and regulate their Lives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a Moral Rule ever after. And therefore the two Tables are put into the Ark, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 4. to ſhew their ſubſerviencie to him, and in this ſenſe, its conſiſtence with him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. For Anſwer whereunto, We do indeed acknowledge the <hi>ſubſerviencie</hi> of the Law to Chriſt, and the Covenant of Grace; in which reſpect it is alſo true, That the Means is not Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to the End, but is always ſubordinate thereunto. But it doth not therefore follow, that <hi>the Law is a Covenant of Goſpel-Grace,</hi> (for that is the only Point we are Contending about, or Enquiring after.) It hath indeed a plain ſubſerviencie; or ſubordination thereunto; as <hi>Hagar</hi> the type of the Bondage Covenant, had unto <hi>Sarah</hi> the type of the Goſpel Covenant. But yet neither is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50207:99"/> the Handmaid the Miſtreſs, nor the Miſtreſs the Handmaid. Theſe two are ſtill diſtinct. The Law is not the Goſpel, nor the Goſpel the Law. And therefore, though the one of them is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſervient to the other, yet they ought not to be mixed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or confounded the one with the other, as if they were but one and the ſame Covenant, and no difference to be made between them; only in reſpect of the Different Degrees of the Diſcovery of Goſpel Grace, as hath been ſuggeſted.</p>
               <p>§. 3. 'Tis true, the Law is appointed as <hi>our School-maſter to Chriſt,</hi> (for ſo the words run in the Original Text, as your ſelves have acknowledged;) that is, to ſhew us the Nature of Sin; together with the Holineſs, and Righteouſneſs of God's Nature and Being; to Convince us of our Sin and Miſery without Chriſt, and our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity therefore of a Saviour. And in all theſe reſpects, it hath Indeed a plain <hi>ſubſerviency</hi> to drive us to Chriſt; and to induce us to fly with the more earneſtneſs to lay hold upon <hi>New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Grace,</hi> wherein Chriſt is plainly exhibited unto us for our Relief. But then it doth not therefore follow, that the Law it ſelf is <hi>ſubſerviently a Covenant of Goſpel-Grace;</hi> or that it is ſuch for the <hi>ſubstance</hi> of it; as both Mr. <hi>Sedgwick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Roberts,</hi> and many other worthy Divines, affirm it is. A ſubſerviency in any thing to promote the Ends of ſomething elſe, doth not make it to be the thing it ſelf; the Ends whereof are promoted thereby. The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of Satan, and the perſecutions of Wicked Men, have a plain <hi>ſubſerviency,</hi> (and that by God's own appointment, through his Over-ruling Providence) to promote the Ends of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace; and to make us fly the more earneſtly thereunto for Succour; yet it would be too abſurd to affirm, that either of theſe are the Covenant of Grace; or ſubſerviently ſuch. So it is in our preſent Caſe: For though the Law is in it ſelf <hi>againſt us, and contrary to us,</hi> as being <hi>a Miniſtration of Death and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> (as the Apoſtle witneſſes it is) in which reſpect the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Covenant is directly oppoſite to the Goſpel-Covenant, (as in our 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Argument following, is more plainly and particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated,) yet through the over-ruling Grace and Mercy of God; the Law with all its thundring Curſes, and Menacies upon every Tranſgreſſion and Diſobedience; inſtead of <hi>deſtroying</hi> us; it is converted to a notable <hi>ſubſerviency</hi> toward our Everlaſting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, by forcing us with the more ſpeed to Chriſt, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace for Relief and Succour: So as that <hi>out of the Eater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comes Meat; and out of the ſtrong, Sweetneſs.</hi> But ſhall we ſay therefore, that the Law it ſelf is a Covenant of Goſpel-Grace,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50207:100"/> (which is conſtantly in the Scripture repreſented unto us as quite another thing) becauſe it hath a ſubſerviency to drive us thither for ſhelter.</p>
               <p>§. 4. So that to allow, that there is indeed a ſubſerviency in the Law to drive us to Jeſus Chriſt, and the Covenant of Grace for Succour; and yet to deny, that the Law it ſelf is therefore a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace,</hi> is Harmonious enough, and implies no Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction at all; (as it hath been ſuggeſted it doth) for as much as it is impoſſible, (and therefore it muſt rather of neceſſity be a plain contradiction on the other hand to affirm) that any thing can be ſubſervient to the Ends of another; and at the ſame time, to be the ſame thing it ſelf, which it is thus ſubſervient unto: For if it be the ſame, how is it ſubſervient to ſomething elſe, as to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? The Law therefore being a Diſtinct Covenant from the Goſpel; it muſt of neceſſity be a <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> unleſs we ſhall ſay, there are two Covenants of Goſpel-Grace; the one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the other faulty; the one to endure for ever, the other to be Repealed, and Blotted out, as being againſt us, and contrary to us; a Miniſtration of Death and Condemnation, (as the Legal Covenant hath been proved to be) which in any ſence, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be applied to the Covenant of Grace, according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Dialect.</p>
               <p>§. 5. It is certain therefore (as hath been before hinted) that the Law ſhuts us up to Chriſt, or Faith, as our only Remedy; and indeed this was, and ſtill is its uſe and deſign; and will be ſo to the end, to all that come to Chriſt; that is, it precludes, or ſhuts us up from all other ways and Expectations of Comfort; by ſhewing us our utter incapacity, to attain unto Life, by our own Righteouſneſs; and therefore forces us, if ever we will be ſaved, to have recourſe to the only Remedy. Accordingly the two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were put into the Ark, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 4. to ſhew their ſubſerviency to Chriſt; and in this ſenſe, its conſiſtence with him; typically demonſtrating, that though the Covenant of Works could not be kept, or performed by us; yet it ſhould be perfectly fulfilled in Chriſt for us: In which reſpect he is ſaid to be the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth. But then it doth not therefore follow, that the Law, that thus ſhuts us up, is the Remedy it ſelf; or that the School-maſters-Rod, that drives us to Chriſt, is Chriſt himſelf, or the Covenant of Grace it ſelf; ſince the Means cannot be the End; nor the end the Means; though the Means is indeed ſubſervient, or ſubordinate thereunto.</p>

               <p>BUT then we are alſo told, <q>That the Intention and Deſign of God, in the Promulgation of the Law at <hi>Sinai,</hi> was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally miſtaken by the Jews, and perverted to a quite contrary end; namely, to obtain Righteouſneſs by their own Works of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it; and ſo to ſlight and oppoſe the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; not conſidering, that <hi>Christ was the end, or ſcope of the Law for Righteouſneſs, to every one that believeth:</hi> Nor that the Law was their <hi>School-maſter,</hi> to convince them of Sin, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency; and ſo drive them to Chriſt their only Remedy. Now this miſtake of God's Intention in giving the Law, is the true Reaſon and Ground of thoſe Seeming Contradictions, which we find in the New-Teſtament. For when the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Law, according to the true end and uſe of it, which God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned it for; then he magnifies the Law, and calls it <hi>Holy, Juſt, and Good; a Spiritual Law, a Good Law: Our School-maſter to Chriſt,</hi> tells us, that <hi>Chriſt is the end of it for Righteouſneſs, to every one that believeth:</hi> With many more high Encomiums of its Excellency and Uſefulneſs. But when he conſiders it, as perverted by men; and reduced again to its Primitive Intention, to give Life and Righteouſneſs by our Obedience to it; then he as much decries, and thunders againſt it; calling it <hi>a Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Death and Condemnation; a weak and beggarly thing;</hi> with many other Notes of Diſparagement. Nor can it be enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried, when inſtead of <hi>Subordination,</hi> it's put in <hi>Competition;</hi> yea, in <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to Chriſt. And that this is no Fiction, or Groundleſs Diſtinction, which Obſcures and Confounds Law and Goſpel; appears not only by the Impoſſibility of Reconciling the Apoſtle with himſelf, but by this means: As alſo, by that plain Text in which it is grounded, Rom. 10. 3, 4. And 1 Tim. 1. 8. <hi>The Law is good, if a Man uſe it lawfully:</hi> That is, i'ts good or bad, according to the uſe men make of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If they take it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe Excellent Ends, for which God Promulged it, <hi>viz.</hi> to prepare them by Convictions for Chriſt: And afterward, when in him, as a moral Rule of Duty and Obedience; then it is Good and Excellent: But if it be made the Ground and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Righteouſneſs, and ſo ſet in oppoſition to Chriſt; then nothing more fatal and pernitious. So that this Diſtinction
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50207:101"/> is the Apoſtles own Diſtinction, given us as a Key, to open this Controverſie by.</q>

               <p>§. 2. <hi>Reply.</hi> But can weindeed think that when the Apoſtle thunders, as he doth againſt the Law; Calling it <hi>a Miniſtration of Diatb and Condemnation; a weak and beggarly thing; that which was againſt us, contrary to us; and that which is therefore now blotted out, and taken out of the way; being nailed to the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.

'Tis true, the Jews did plainly pervert, and miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood God's Deſign and Intention, in giving the Law as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works unto them; which was not, that any Perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, ſhould ever attain unto Life and Righteouſneſs thereby; but only to Convince them of their Neceſſity of a Saviour. But doth it therefore follow, that all thoſe thundring Expreſſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, concerning the Law, were uttered by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, only becauſe the Jews had <hi>perverted it?</hi> Doth not <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf call it <hi>a Fiery Law, that proceeded from God's right Hand,</hi> Deut. 33. 2.

                  </gap> great an abuſe as the Law, by being turned into Laſciviouſneſs; as the Scriptures tells us it was; and yet the Apoſtle never thunders againſt the Goſpel, as he doth againſt the Law, becauſe Men had abuſed it. 'Tis true, he tells us concerning the Goſpel; that <hi>to ſome it is the ſavour of death, unto death, to others it is the ſavour of life, unto life;</hi> that is, to thoſe that <hi>Reject it,</hi> it is the ſavour of death unto death; to thoſe that <hi>Receive it,</hi> it is the ſavour of life, unto life. But this is vaſtly different from the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter he gives of the Law: For (ſaith he) <hi>By the deeds of the Law, there ſhall no Fleſh be juſtified in his ſight,</hi> Rom. 3. 20. And therefore, whether it is Received or Rejected, it is, as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>a Ministration of Death,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas the Goſpel is ſuch, only to thoſe that Reject it, and do not give a ſaving entertainment to it. So that the Diſtinction we now op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is altogether without Scripture Warrant; and is indeed no other, than to impute unfaithfulneſs to <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo, in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50207:101"/> declaring the Nature of the Law as they do. And accordingly hence we have juſt reaſon to conclude, that the Law was never inſtituted as a Covenant of Faith,, or as a Covenant of Grace, that hath ſuch Epethites fixed thereon by the Spirit of God himſelf.</p>
               <p>§. 3. 'Tis true, as you ſay, <hi>the Law was our School-maſter to Chriſt;</hi> to Convince us of our Neceſſity of him. And Chriſt is alſo ſaid to be <hi>the end of the Law, for Righteouſneſs, to every one that believeth;</hi> that is, he was the <hi>accompliſhment</hi> thereof; he having perfectly fulfilled its Commands, ſubmitted to its Curſe, and anſwered its Penalty on our behalf; whereby it received the Greateſt Honour that could be given it; a greater by far, than ever could be given it by us, in our own perſons. <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak, through the Fleſh; God ſending his own Son, in the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh, and for ſin,</hi> (or by a Sacrifice for Sin) <hi>condemned Sin in the Fleſh; that the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us;</hi> that is, in the Perſon of our Sure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But then it is ſo far from being true, that the Law was therefore a <hi>Covenant of Faith;</hi> that it is ſo much the more Convincingly Evident, that it was no other than a <hi>Covenant of Works:</hi> For as much as it is plain, that, as ſuch, <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf ſubmitted thereunto on our account. And it is as plain that, as ſuch, it would elſe have lighted on us in our <hi>own Perſons,</hi> in the Execution of its moſt dreadful Curſes and Threatnings. But if we will rather have the ſenſe of the words to be, as you ſuggeſt it is, that Chriſt was <hi>the End</hi> [or Scope] <hi>of the Law for Righteouſneſs, to every one that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth;</hi> that is, that it was God's deſign, thereby to drive them to Chriſt, their only Remedy, by Convincing them of their Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of him; It ſtill comes to the ſame Reckoning: For though 'tis true, there is a plain <hi>ſubſerviency</hi> in the Law, towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of the Deſigns of the <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> yet (as we have already ſeen) it no way follows, that the Law is therefore the Covenant of Grace it ſelf; or the Handmaid the Miſtreſs her ſelf: For (ſaith the Apoſtle, Gal. 4. 24. 25, 26.) <hi>Theſe are the two Covenants; the one from Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>which gendereth to Bondage, and is in Bondage with her Children: The other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>that is above; which is free, and is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us all.</hi> And if theſe were the <hi>two Covenants,</hi> and thoſe two <hi>eſſentially</hi> different the one from the other, in the nature and tendency of either; as it is plain by the Apoſtles ſcope they are; ſo they muſt be kept. Two they were, and two they ſtill remain to be; ſo as what the one is, the other is not. <hi>Hagar</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50207:102"/> a plain <hi>ſubſerviency</hi> to <hi>Sarah:</hi> But yet as were the Types, ſo are the Antitypes themſelves; <hi>Eſſentially</hi> different; ſo as that the Bondage Covenant, can with no more Senſe, nor Juſtice be called a Covenant of Faith, becauſe it hath a <hi>ſubſerviency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;</hi> than the Covenant of Faith can wiſh any ſhadow of pretence be called a Covenant of Bondage.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Beſides, when the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the two Covenants, <hi>theſe were the two Covenants;</hi> the one from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Legal; the other the Goſpel Covenant. He doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently Intimate, that there were never but two General Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; made with Mankind, in all; that is, the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace. And if ſo, then if there were any ſuch thing as a Covenant of Works made with our firſt Parent before the Fall (as we all affirm there was) it muſt of neceſſity be Included in the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant; And that both <hi>Materially</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and <hi>Intentionally</hi> alſo: Elſe there were three Covenants; and thoſe <hi>Specifically</hi> different each from other; whereas the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us but of two. To ſay it was Included in the Goſpel Covenant is wholly Abſurd; Therefore it muſt of neceſſity be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant; ſo as that both together make up that <hi>firſt or old Covenant,</hi> which the Scripture ſpeaks of. For when the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. calls the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant by the Name of <hi>the firſt or Old Covenant</hi> (as he there doth ſeveral times over) it cannot poſſibly be underſtood that it was therefore the firſt Covenant that God ever made with Men <hi>in reſpect of time;</hi> for there had been an <hi>Expreſs Covenant</hi> made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and with <hi>Noah</hi> alſo, long before; And we alſo acknowledge that there was an <hi>Implicite Covenant of Works</hi> made with our firſt Parent, upon his firſt Creation beſides the <hi>Promiſe of Grace</hi> that followed ſoon after the Fall. Therefore the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant muſt of neceſſity be called <hi>the firſt or old Covenant,</hi> becauſe of its Congruity, Harmony, and Identity, with the Covenant of Works made with our firſt Parent; And that both in reſpect of the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and <hi>Intention</hi> thereof alſo; Or elſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§. 5. The Law therefore could not poſſibly be a Covenant of Goſpel Grace; (as by many the moſt Learned and Worthy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and it may be the far greater part (of Moderns at leaſt) it hath been confidently affirmed to be) For (as we have before

And this is the Point, the onely Point, which in the beginning of this Diſcourſe we undertook to diſprove; And that as being of no ſmall Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the Church of God.

               <p>§. 6: As for the Scripture before alledged, 1 Tim. 1. 8. <hi>We know that the Law is good if a Man uſe it Lawfully;</hi> It is indeed highly obſervable: For as much as there is a <hi>Lawful</hi> as well as an <hi>unlawful</hi> uſe that Men may make thereof; that is, if we make uſe of it as the <hi>Rule of our Obedience,</hi> then we make that Right, Juſt, Proper, and <hi>Lawful uſe</hi> thereof, which God requires. For we know that in this Reſpect we are ſtill <hi>under the Law to Chriſt.</hi> And in this Reſpect it is true enough, as the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But if we Preach it up, or endeavour to Eſtabliſh it, as <hi>a Covenant of Life;</hi> or as a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Faith,</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> (which are Equipollent terms; Let us diſtinguiſh as we pleaſe, between a Covenant of Grace Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and ſubſerviently ſuch) and conſequently are <hi>deſirous</hi> in that Reſpect to be <hi>under it</hi> (as the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Gallatians,</hi> and which we cannot avoid if we reckon it to be a Covenant of Grace) then, according to the Apoſtles plain Scope, in the whole Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Gallatians;</hi> inſtead of <hi>uſing it lawfully,</hi> we make an <hi>unlawful uſe</hi> thereof, by perverting it to

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50207:104"/> Body of that People, without exception of any, were for the time appointed of the Father; under the Dominion and Tiranny of the Law; and that as a Covenant of Works, or a Bondage Covenant; when yet it is equally as evident, that at the ſame time, all the Elect among them, were under a Covenant of pure Goſpel Grace, whereby they were ſaved.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Wherefore we muſt grant, that God's People were then under <hi>two distinct;</hi> or <hi>eſſentially different Covenants:</hi> We ſay, we muſt do ſo; provided always, that the way of <hi>Reconciliation, and Salvation,</hi> was the ſame under both. But it will be ſaid, and with great pretence of Reaſon, (for it is that which is the ſole Foundation they all build upon, who affirm the Legal and the Goſpel-Covenants, to be only a <hi>twofold Adminiſtration</hi> of the ſame Covenant) That this being the Principal End of a Divine Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: If the <hi>way of Reconciliation</hi> and Salvation be <hi>the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both,</hi> then indeed they are for the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of them but one: And we grant, that this would inevitably follow, If it were ſo equally <hi>by vertue</hi> of them both.

               <p>ANd here we ſhould have drawn up the ſum of what hath been already offered on the preſent Subject; but that there are four Arguments yet behind, pretending to prove, that the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, and that made with <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, were not the ſame, but widely different Covenants; which remain therefore to be Anſwered. Only by the way it muſt be remembred, that two Arguments to the ſame purpoſe, have already been diſpatcht. The Firſt was, That though the <hi>Sinai Covenant, materially</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is the ſame with <hi>Adams;</hi> yet <hi>intentionally,</hi> it is vaſtly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. The Second was; That the <hi>Sinai Covenant</hi> had a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi> which <hi>Adams</hi> wanted. Both which, we hope, have been Satisfactorily Anſwered, in the foregoing parts of this Diſcourſe. It remains therefore, that we proceed to the Conſideration of thoſe that follow; The firſt whereof runs thus;</p>
               <p>Arg. 1. <hi>Thoſe Covenants that differ in the</hi> Subjects, <hi>or</hi> Parties <hi>with whom they are made, are not the ſame, but different Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: But ſo doth that at</hi> Sinai, <hi>and that in Paradice. The Covenant made with</hi> Adam, <hi>was made with</hi> Innocent <hi>and</hi> Perfect Man, <hi>able to keep it; This with</hi> Lapſed, Sinful Man, <hi>utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to keep any one Precept of it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> To which we Reply; That the difference betwixt the <hi>Subjects,</hi> makes no alteration in the <hi>Substance,</hi> or <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the Covenants; Eſpecially ſince we have already, by ſeveral Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſubſtantially proved; not only that they were <hi>Materially</hi> the ſame (which your ſelves cannot but acknowledge) but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally</hi> alſo. And foraſmuch as 'tis undeniable, That God hath not forfeited or loſt his Right of Sovereignty, or Dominion over us, though we have forfeited and loſt our ſtrength and capacity of Obedience; the Covenants in queſtion therefore may very well be the ſame, notwithſtanding the difference betwixt their Subjects.</p>
               <p>Arg. 2. <hi>Thoſe Covenants that vaſtly differ in their</hi> Dedication, <hi>are not the ſame but divers: But ſo doth the Covenants with</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>and with</hi> Adam. <hi>The Covenant with</hi> Adam <hi>taught no way of the Expiation of Sins by the Dedication of it; ſo did that with</hi> Moſes, Exod. 24. 8. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>took the Blood, and ſprinkled it on the People, and ſaid; Behold, this is the Blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which the Lord hath made with you, concerning all theſe words.</hi>

               <p> 
                  <hi>Reply:</hi> To this we Reply; That it hath been already proved, That though the <hi>Ceremonial Covenant,</hi> was indeed dedicated with Blood, and Sprinkling; yet the <hi>Law written in Stones</hi> was no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. So that if <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant wanted Confirmation, or Dedication with Blood, ſhewing the Remiſſion of Sins; ſo did that written in Stones alſo: And therefore in this reſpect there is no difference at all betwixt them. True it is, that the Ceremonial Covenant was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o dedicated; in which reſpect there is a plain difference betwixt that, and the Covenant made with <hi>Adam.</hi> But this alters not the Caſe; For it is evident, that the Law written in Stones, was not ſo dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; and that is enough to prove what we have all along aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>That the Covenant of Works made with our First Parent, was renewed to that People in the Wilderneſs.</hi> And though 'tis true, the Ceremonial Covenant being dedicated as it was, did point unto Chriſt, and the way of Salvation by him; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, it hath been already proved, that it was a Covenant of Works, as well as that written in Stones; and therefore both of them now Repealed, to make way for the <hi>New Covenant, which was eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes.</hi> And it having been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that they were both, no other than two ſeveral Editions of the ſame Covenant of Works; and that neither of them can, with any ſhadow of Truth or Juſtice, be ſtiled <hi>a Covenant of Grace, or a Goſpel Covenant</hi> (which cannot be affirmed without contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Scope of the Scriptures) it ſufficiently ſerves the deſign we level at; whether there be a <hi>Perfect Identity</hi> in every Circumſtance between either of theſe, and <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant or no. For as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> well obſerves; <q>Whatever variations may be made in, or Additions unto the Diſpenſation of the Firſt Covenant, ſo long as this Rule is retained, <hi>Do this and Live;</hi> it is ſtill the ſame Covenant for the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and <hi>Eſſence</hi> of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Arg. 3. <hi>Thoſe Covenants which vaſtly differ in the Priviledges contained in them, are not juſt the ſame, but far different Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: But ſo doth the Covenant with</hi> Adam, <hi>and that with</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>differ. In</hi> Adam<hi>'s Covenant no Pardon was admitted or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted upon Repentance: But ſo it is in</hi> Moſes <hi>Covenant; God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed himſelf at the Promulgation of it, a Sin Pardoning God,</hi> Exod. 34. <hi>And promiſeth Pardon on Repentance for the Breach of it,</hi> Lev. 26. <hi>from</hi> verſ. 40. <hi>to</hi> verſ. 46. <hi>If you ſay this was the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with</hi> Abraham, <hi>not with</hi> Moſes; <hi>then</hi> Abraham's <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, was the Covenant of Grace: But ſee,</hi> verſ. 46. <hi>and all is ended.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> The Anſwer we have returned to the foregoing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may very well ſerve for this alſo. For if the <hi>Sinai</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50207:105"/> which was delivered by Gods own immediate Mouth and Voice; and which was alſo written with God's own Finger, upon the two Tables of Stone; was not dedicated with Blood and Sprinkling (which ſhewed Remiſſion of Sins) as the Ceremonial Covenant was; then it plainly follows, that in this reſpect alſo, there is no difference between this and the Covenant made with <hi>Adam:</hi> For if in <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant, no Pardon of Sin was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or accepted upon Repentance, as wanting that which ſhewed the Expiation thereof; ſo it was in this. But whereas you ſay, that at the Promulgation of <hi>Moſes</hi> Covenant, God proclaimed himſelf a Sin Pardoning God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. We freely acknowledge he did ſo; for elſe none had been ſaved. But then we have alſo proved, that the Covenant of Grace, there mentioned, was vaſtly diſtinct, and eſſencially different from that mentioned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. The one being made with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Elect only; the other with the whole Body of the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were they two diſtinct Covenants, in reſpect of their different Subjects; but in reſpect of their vaſtly different nature alſo: For though the Covenant or Promiſes mentioned in the 33d and 34th Chapters of <hi>Exodus,</hi> expreſly declared God to be a Sin Pardoning God; A God <hi>Merciful and Gratious, forgiving Iniquity, Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and Sin;</hi> yet there is nothing that can be more evident than this, that the <hi>other</hi> diſcovered no ſuch thing, but rather the contrary. <q>The Jewiſh Legal Covenant (ſaith Dr. <hi>Anneſley)</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther admitted of Faith in the Redeemer, nor Repentance of Sin. For Pardon of Sin, and Curſe for Sin, are inconſiſtent, Gal. 3. 10. <hi>As many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curſe: For it is written, Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</hi> As many as depend upon the Works of the Law for Juſtification, are under the Curſe, And the Law diſcovered no other way of Juſtification but by Works, <hi>Morn.

               </p>
               <p>§. 2. But (ſay you) God promiſeth Pardon, on Repentance, for the Breach of <hi>Moſes</hi> Covenant, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 40, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And (ſay we) ſo he did in reſpect of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant; for otherwiſe we had all been undone for ever. But as <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant promiſed no Pardon on Repentance, ſo neither did the <hi>Jewiſh Legal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:</hi> For indeed it rather threatens, and inflicts the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> a dreadful Curſe upon every Tranſgreſſion and Diſobedience; and as the Doct. well obſerves, admits of no Repentance. For as it is evident, that the Law written in Stones, neither diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor admits of any ſuch thing: So as for the Ceremonial Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50207:106"/> it ſelf; the Apoſtle expreſly tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9. that the Sacrifices thereof <hi>could not make him, that did the Service per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as pertaining to the Conſcience: For</hi> (ſaith he, Chap. 10. 1, 4.) <hi>the the Law having a ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very Image of the things, can never with thoſe Sacrifices which they offered year by year continually, make the Comers thereunto perfect.—For it is not poſſible, that the Blood of Bulls and of Goats, ſhould take away Sins.</hi> Other Covenants ('tis true) there were, wherein God plainly diſcovered the mercifulneſs of his nature in that reſpect: And among the reſt, the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> which in the forementioned <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. God doth plainly direct them to for their Relief. But (ſay you) if you ſay, This was the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> not with <hi>Moſes;</hi> then <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant was the Covenant of Grace. But yet (ſay we) neither will this do the buſineſs you alledge it for: For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diligently examined, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 40, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We find recorded to this purpoſe; that in the latter days, after that the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould have been ſcattered into all Nations, and had all ſorts of Plagues inflicted on them for their ſins: <hi>If</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>they ſhall confeſs their ſins, and the iniquities of their Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then will I remember my Covenant with</hi> Jacob, <hi>and alſo my Covenant with</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and alſo my Covenant with</hi> Abraham <hi>will I Remember.</hi> From whence, Firſt, It may be plainly collected, that there was no Pardon to be expected by them, from the <hi>Sinai Covenant:</hi> For God doth not direct them to apply themſelves thither for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; nor doth he in the leaſt ſuggeſt, that that way any thing of Pardon could be juſtly expected by them: But he directs them rather to have recourſe unto the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> for that is the Covenant (ſaith God) that I will Remember. And Secondly, It ought alſo to be duly obſerved, that though the <hi>Covenant of Circumciſion,</hi> which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17. 7, 8, 9, 10. was indeed of the ſame nature with the <hi>Sinai Covenant</hi> (as we have already proved;) yet it is evident, that God had long before the Covenant of Circumciſion was in being, entred into a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> or a Covenant that was truly <hi>Evangelical,</hi> with Believing <hi>Abraham,</hi> wherein God freely promiſed, That <hi>in him,</hi> that is, <hi>in his Seed, all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 12. 2, 3. And accordingly, this is the Covenant that <hi>Peter</hi> directs the Bleeding Jews unto in his time, Act. 3. 25. <hi>Ye are the Children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant which God made with our Fathers; ſaying unto</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>and in thy Seed ſhall all the Kindreds of the Earth be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> Which free Goſpel Promiſe doth plainly comprehend both
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50207:106"/> 
                  <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And this therefore undoubtedly, is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that God tells them in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> he will Remember for the future Comfort of Diſtreſſed and diſperſed <hi>Iſrael:</hi> For as <hi>Peter</hi> refers the Jews thereunto and unto that alone, ſo this very Covenant, and that in theſe very terms, had not onely been made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but as God here ſpeaks with <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 24. 4. and with <hi>Jacob</hi> alſo: <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 14. Whereas the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion had not been ſo Renewed or Repeated: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this muſt be the onely Covenant that God here ſpeaks of. And whereas God tells them Verſ. 45. That <hi>he would for their ſakes remember the Covenant of their Anceſtors, whom he brought forth out of the Land of Egypt.</hi> This muſt of neceſſity have Reference either to the forementioned Covenant with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob:</hi> Or the Promiſes mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 34. And cannot poſſibly have any Reference to the <hi>Sinai Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:</hi> For that was a <hi>Bondage Covenant,</hi> Gal. 4. 21, 22, &amp;c. <hi>A Miniſtration of Death and Condemnation,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 7, 8, 9. <hi>Againſt us and contrary to us;</hi> And therefore now <hi>Blotted out,</hi> Col. 2. 14. And is accordingly by <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf repreſented as <hi>a fiery Law that Proceeded from Gods Right Hand,</hi> Deut. 33. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. So that that could not poſſibly yield any comfort unto them: Whereas the forementioned Covenants did plainly give them hopes of Relief and Pardon. But (ſay you) ſee <hi>Verſ.</hi> 46. and all is ended. We have therefore accordingly Examined that Text; But cannot diſcern that it ſpeaks any thing by way of oppoſition to what we have Aſſerted: For thus run the words. <hi>Theſe are the Statutes and Judgments, and Laws which the Lord made between him, and the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>at Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>by the Hand of Moſes,</hi> which can have no other Senſe than this, That this being the laſt Verſe of the laſt Chapte (ſave one) of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> wherein the Statutes and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or the ſeveral branches of the Ceremonial Law had been particularly Rehearſed unto them: Theſe words in this <hi>46th Verſe</hi> contains therefore onely the general Sum thereof; So that we cannot diſcern that it makes off or on as to the preſent Argument.</p>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. The Fourth and laſt Argument runs thus; Thoſe Covenants which have Seals annexed of vaſtly different Nature, are not Abſolutely or juſt the ſame, but widely different Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: But ſo have theſe two Covenants; <hi>Ergo,</hi> not the ſame. The Tree of Life was the onely Sacrament Annext to the firſt; but the Paſſover and Circumciſion to the laſt: Both holding forth Chriſt and Salvation by him. The firſt a plain Type
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50207:107" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Chriſt in the Paſchal Lamb. The other <hi>a Seal of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Firſt, as to what concerns the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> which you ſay was the onely <hi>Sacrament</hi> annext to <hi>Adams Covenant;</hi> That it was either a <hi>Sacrament</hi> or a <hi>Seal</hi> annext to that Covenant, the Scripture gives us no Account thereof that we can find. And as the <hi>Paſſover</hi> and <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> which you make to be the <hi>Seals</hi> of the <hi>Sinai Covenant,</hi> the Scripture is as ſilent even in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect alſo. As for the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> it was indeed as you ſay, a plain <hi>Type</hi> of Chriſt, as many other things then were: But we do not find that it is ever called, a <hi>Seal of the Sinai Covenant;</hi> Nor do we find that Circumciſion is ever called <hi>the Seal</hi> thereof. It is indeed called <hi>a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith that</hi> Abraham <hi>had yet being uncircumcized,</hi> Rom. 4. 11. But the ſame Apoſtle expreſly tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 12. That <hi>the Law is not of Faith.</hi> And if the Law is not of Faith, then neither can it be <hi>a Covenant of Faith;</hi> And then it doth alſo as plainly follow, that Circumciſion, which is by the Apoſtle termed a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, could not be <hi>the Seal thereof.</hi> And in this Reſpect therefore it is highly obſervable; That though Circumciſion is frequently called a <hi>Token of the Covenant</hi> mentioned. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9. to the generality that were under it; yet the Scripture no where tells us, That it was <hi>a Seal of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith,</hi> but unto <hi>Abraham</hi> onely: For indeed none elſe had ever before or after their Circumciſion, ſuch a Faith that Entituled them to ſuch Singular Promiſes, and Prerogatives as <hi>Abraham</hi> had. But of this we have already ſaid ſo much, toward the Reſolution of the preſent Point, in the Seventh Branch of our Anſwer to the Eleventh Objection, in the Second Part of this Diſcourſe foregoing; and have yet ſo much to ſay in what follows, where we ſhall have a further occaſion purpoſely to handle this Argument, that we ſhall need to ſay the leſs of it here.</p>

               <p>FOR a Concluſion of the preſent Point, we ſhall onely Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the ſum of the foregoing Arguments already Inſiſted on; proving that the Legal Covenant was not a Covenant of Faith: But was indeed and in truth, no other than a Covenant of Works. For;</p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:50207:107"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Covenant that is not of Faith, cannot poſſibly be a Covenant of Faith. But the Apoſtle doth expreſly affirm, that, <hi>the Law is not of Faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 11, 12. Therefore neither can it be a Covenant of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Covenant which is now Repealed could not be a Covenant of Faith. But the Apoſtle doth plainly affirm, that the firſt Covenant for the faultineſs thereof, is now Repealed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7, 13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 11. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 18. Therefore that Covenant could not be a Covenant of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Covenant that could not give Life, could not be a Covenant of Faith: But the Law could not give Life, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21. 22. Therefore it could not be a Covenant of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That Covenant that is oppoſed to the Covenant of Faith, as quite another thing, could not be a Covenant of Faith. But the School-maſterſhip of the Law, is by the Apoſtle plainly oppoſed, and contradiſtinguiſhed unto the Covenant of Faith, as quite another thing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23, 24, 25. Therefore it could not be a Covenant of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That Covenant, the Righteouſneſs whereof is oppoſed to the Righteouſneſs of Faith; cannot be a Covenant of Faith. But the Righteouſneſs of the Law is plainly by the Apoſtle oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Righteouſneſs of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore it could not be a Covenant of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That Covenant that could never Juſtifie any that were under it, could never be a Covenant of Faith. <hi>For being Juſtified by Faith, we have Peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 5. 1. But the Scripture doth expreſly Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; That <hi>by the Deeds of the Law, there ſhall no Fleſh be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his Sight,</hi> Rom. 3. 20. Therefore that Covenant could never be a Covenant of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> That Covenant under which, though many were Juſtified; yet none were ever Juſtified <hi>by it,</hi> or <hi>by vertue</hi> of it; could never be a Covenant of Faith. But ſuch is the Nature of the Law, that though many were Juſtified under it; yet none were ever Juſtified by it, or by Vertue of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Covenant could never be a Covenant of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> That Covenant that ſaith, <hi>Do this and Live;</hi> Or that <hi>the Man that doth theſe things ſhall Live by them;</hi> cannot poſſibly be a Covenant of Goſpel-Grace, but of Works: Since the Apoſtle Informs us, That <hi>to him that worketh is the Reward reckoned, not of Grace but of Debt,</hi> Rom. 4. 4. But the ſame Apoſtle doth expreſly tell us; That <hi>Moſes deſcribeth the Righteouſneſs of the Law, that the Man which doth theſe things</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:50207:108" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>ſhall live by them,</hi> Rom. 10. 5., Therefore that Covenant could be no other than a Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> That Covenant that is plainly and in direct terms op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed unto Grace, cannot be a Covenant of Grace. But the Law is by the Apoſtle directly oppoſed unto Grace. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have Dominion over you: For ye are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> Therefore that Covenant could never be a Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenthly,</hi> That Covenant that was not onely by the <hi>Jews</hi> Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated as a Covenant of Works, but was ſo by Gods own Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muſt needs be a Covenant of Works. But the Law was not onely by the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo Reckoned, but by Gods own Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it was expreſly ſo deſigned, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 4, 5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10, 12. Therefore that Covenant muſt needs be a Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> That Covenant through which <hi>Abrahams</hi> Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was not derived, could not be a Covenant of Faith but of Works. But the Apoſtle doth expreſly tell us, <hi>That if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance be of the Law, it is no more of Promiſe: But God gave it to</hi> Abraham <hi>by Promiſe,</hi> Gal. 3. 18. Therefore the Law could not poſſibly be a Covenant of Faith, but of Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> That Covenant through which had the Inheritance been conveyed, would have made void Faith, and made the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of none effect, could not poſſibly be a Covenant of Faith. But the Apoſtle doth expreſly tell us; That <hi>if they which are of the Law be Heirs, Faith is made void, and the Promiſe made of none effect,</hi> Rom. 4. 14. Therefore the Law could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be a Covenant of Faith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirteenthly,</hi> That Covenant from the Curſe whereof, we were Redeemed by Chriſt, could not be a Covenant of Grace, but of Works. But the Apoſtle Informs us; That <hi>Chriſt hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us from the Curſe of the Law; himſelf being made a Curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. chap. 4. 4, 5. Therefore the Law could not be a Covenant of Grace but of Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourteenthly,</hi> That Covenant that is ſet forth by the Apoſtle as a Miniſtration of Death, and Condemnation, could be no other than a Covenant of Works. But the Apoſtle doth aſſure us, that the Law Written in Stones was <hi>a Miniſtration of Death and Condemnation,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 7, 9. Therefore it could be no other than a Covenant of Works,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifteenthly,</hi> That Covenant in which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Hand writing of Ordinances contained, was <hi>againſt us, and contrary to us,</hi> which is therefore now <hi>Blotted out, and taken out of the way, being Nailed</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:50207:108"/> 
                  <hi>to the Croſs of Chriſt;</hi> could be no other than a Covenant of Works. But ſuch is the Nature of the Law, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8, 9. Therefore it could be no other than a Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixteenthly,</hi> That Covenant which when it comes, Revives Sin, and kills the Sinner; And which though it was Ordained to Life, is by Experience found to be unto Death, could not be a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace: But <hi>Paul</hi> doth expreſly tell us; That <hi>when the Commandment came, Sin Revived and he died. And the Commandment which was Ordained to Life, he found to be unto Death,</hi> Rom. 7. 9, 10. Therefore that Covenant could not be a Covenant of Grace but of Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventeenthly,</hi> That Covenant that is a Bondage Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which gendereth to Bondage; all whoſe Children alſo are in Bondage, cannot poſſibly be a Covenant of Faith, but of Works. But the Apoſtle doth Expreſly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, that <hi>Mount</hi> Sinai <hi>Covenant is a Bondage Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> that is <hi>gendereth to Bondage,</hi> and that <hi>her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> alſo <hi>are in Bondage,</hi> Gal. 4. 21, 22, 23, 24, 26. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant could be no other than a Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighteenthly,</hi> That Covenant that admitted not of Faith in the Redeemer, nor Repentance of Sin: Since Pardon of Sin and Curſe for Sin are Inconſiſtent; could not be a Covenant of Grace. But the Scripture doth expreſly aſſure us; That <hi>as many as are of the Works of the Law are under the Curſe: For it is Written, Curſed is every one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth not in all things which are Written in the Book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. Therefore that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant could not poſſibly be a Covenant of Grace but of Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nineteenthly,</hi> That Covenant that had not Chriſt for the Mediator of it, could never be a Covenant of Faith but of Works. But the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Legal Covenant made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> tells us; That <hi>Chriſt hath obtained a more Excellent Miniſtry, by how much alſo he is the Mediator of a better Covenant, which was Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon better Promiſes,</hi> Heb. 8. 6, 7, 8. 9. From whence it plainly follows, that Chriſt was not the Mediator of the Legal Covenant. Therefore that Covenant could never be a Covenant of Faith, but of Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twentiethly,</hi> That Covenant that was not Confirmed by the Blood of Chriſt (which alone can cleanſe us from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs)
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50207:109"/> but onely by the Bloud of Bulls, and Goats, and Calves, and the Aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the unclean, which onely Sanctified to the Purifying of the Fleſh, and could never take away Sins, nor make him that did the Service perfect as pertaining to the Conſcience; could not be a Covenant of Faith. But the Ceremonial Law was of this Nature, and the Sacrifices thereof, wherewith alone it was Dedicated, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9, 10. 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. Therefore that Covenant could not poſſibly be a Covenant of Faith but of Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twenty firſt,</hi> That Covenant that was not confirmed by the Bloud of Chriſt; No, nor ſo much as by the Bloud of Bulls, or Goats, or Calves, which was plainly Typical thereof; could never be a Covenant of Grace but of Works. But the Law Written in Stones was ſo far from being confirmed by the Bloud of Chriſt, that it was never (that we read of) Dedicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any other ſort of Bloud whatſoever. Therefore that Covenant could not poſſibly be a Covenant of Grace, but of Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twenty ſecond,</hi> That Covenant that is Repreſented to us in the Scripture as a Fiery, Burning Law; the Proclamation alſo where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was attended with dreadful Thunderings and Lightenings; with Blackneſs and Darkneſs, and Tempeſt; And ſuch a Voice of Words as could not be endured, which made <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to quake and tremble, could not be a Covenant of Faith, but of Works. But ſuch was the Nature and Quality of the Legal Covenant at Mount <hi>Sinai, Exod.</hi> 20. 18. 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 18, 19, 20, 21. Therefore that Covenant could not be a Covenant of Faith but of Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twenty third,</hi> That Covenant that is juſt oppoſite to the Goſpel Covenant; which the Scripture repreſents unto us as a Covenant of Peace and Liberty, making a Joyful found, and ſpeaking with a ſmall, ſtill, comfortable, and alluring Voice, in the Ears, and to the Hearts of Sinners; that hath alſo <hi>Jeſus for the Mediator thereof,</hi> and <hi>ſpeaketh better things than the Bloud of</hi> Abel; Proclaiming <hi>the Lord, the Lord God, Gracious, and Merciful, Abundant in Goodneſs, and in Truth, forgiving Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin.</hi> That Covenant can never be a Covenant of Grace, but of Works. But the Legal Covenant is plainly in Scripture oppoſed unto the Goſpel Covenant in all theſe Reſpects, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. from the <hi>18th</hi> to the <hi>24th Gal.</hi> 3. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore the Legal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50207:110"/> Covenant of Grace with Believing <hi>Abraham,</hi> even ſuch a Covenant as was purely Evengelical, and that which never ſhall be aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And it is alſo as evident, that this Goſpel Covenant had been Eſtabliſhed and Preached unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> long before the Covenant of Circumciſion was made with him: (For both <hi>Abraham</hi> and all true Believers, in that Age, were in the Covenant of Grace long before the Covenant of Circumciſion was made, and would have been ſo, if that had never been) which Covenant of Grace or Goſpel Covenant, which God was thus pleaſed to make with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Abraham,</hi> is indeed the great Charter, by which the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles always did, and do claim Heaven and Earth, and all the Promiſes they have title to. For in this reſpect it is, that the Apoſtle tells us as he doth, Gal. 3. 8. That <hi>the Scripture, foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the Heathen through Faith; preached before the Goſpel unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>ſaying; in thee ſhall all Nations be Bleſſed;</hi> Which he quoteth not from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8. but from <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2, 3. Where before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s removal out of his own Country (and therefore long before the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was in being) God enters into a ſolemn Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaying; <hi>I will make of thee a great Nation, and I will bleſs thee, and make thy Name great; and thou ſhalt be a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.

               </p>
               <p>§. 2. If we are to ſeek therefore of the Covenant of Grace that God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is the Great Charter of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles hope; behold and ſee, lo here it is; a Covenant of Grace indeed. A Covenant truly Evangelical, as being every way Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, Full, Free, Abſolute, and without thoſe Conditions that the Covenant of Circumciſion was manifeſtly clogged withal. And therefore called the Covenant of Promiſe, in the forementioned 3d of the <hi>Galatians;</hi> for having told us, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. of the Promiſe that God had made unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>in Him ſhould all Nations be Bleſſed.</hi> And having alſo told us, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. 16. that <hi>the bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>was to come on the Gentiles through Jeſus Chriſt, that we might receive the Promiſe of the Spirit through Faith.</hi> He adds, verſ. 17, 18. <hi>And this I ſay, that the Covenant that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed before of God in Chriſt; the Law which was</hi> 430 <hi>years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, cannot diſanul that it ſhould make the Promiſe of none Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For if the Inheritance be of the Law, it is no more of Promiſe; but God gave it to</hi> Abraham <hi>by Promiſe.</hi> Which clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argues the Abſoluteneſs of this Goſpel Covenant: For if it had
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50207:111"/> not been Free and Abſolute, but Conditional, as the Covenant of Circumciſion was, and as the Legal Covenant at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was; then according to the Scope of the Apoſtles Reaſoning, it had not properly been a Covenant of Promiſe, but a Legal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and ſo the Inheritance had been of the Law: For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in differs the Law from a free Promiſe, but that the one is Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, the other Abſolute? The one promiſeth Life upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Obedience; the other without Mony, and without Price, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. And therefore the Covenant which God made with the Iſraelites at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> though it had many Glorious Promiſes in it; that God would be their God, and they ſhould be his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar People, and Treaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet theſe Promiſes being clogged with Conditions of Obedience, impoſſible to be performed: That Covenant therefore is never preſented to us in the Scripture, under the Notion, or Denomination of a Covenant of Promiſe; but under the Denomination of the Law, or as a Covenant of Works only. <hi>For</hi> Moſes (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>deſcribeth the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Law, that the man that doth theſe things ſhall live by them,</hi> Rom. 10. 5, And ſo likewiſe, Gal. 3. 10. <hi>As many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curſe: For it is written, Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</hi> And verſ. 12. <hi>The Law is not of Faith, but the man that doth them, ſhall live in them.</hi> And for the ſame Reaſon therefore is the Covenant of Circumciſion, repreſented to us alſo, under the ſame Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law: <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. (as ſhall be afterward ſhewn) becauſe though it is true, it had Promiſes in it that were full and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough; yet thoſe Promiſes being not abſolute, but conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as the Covenant at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was, it is therefore repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us under the ſame Character; and not as a Covenant of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or an Evangelical Covenant: For that is the Peculiar Character or Denomination which is given by the Holy Spirit himſelf, to the forementioned Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2, 3. which God had made with <hi>Abraham</hi> long before.</p>
               <p>§. 3. <q>Wherefore (ſaith Dr. <hi>Owen)</hi> the Covenant of Grace; ſuppoſing it a New, Real Abſolute Covenant, and not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Old, or a Reduction of it unto the uſe of our preſent Condition (as ſome, ſaith he, imagine it to be) muſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the Eſſence, Subſtance, and Nature of it from that Firſt Covenant of Works, <hi>Ibid. ut ſupra,</hi> p. 389.</q>

               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:50207:111"/>
               <p> §. 4. <q>The Covenant of Grace (ſaith Mr. <hi>Troughton,</hi> in a late Diſcourſe of his, Entituled, <hi>Lutherus Redivivus, Part.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 111.) is expreſſed in the Nature and Form of a Promiſe, throughout the Scripture. Thus it was to our Firſt Parents, ſoon after the fall, a Promiſe that the Seed of the Woman ſhould overcome the Devil and his Seed: No Terms, no Conditions added, but a bare Declaration of Mercy to their Dejected, Self-condemned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. Next when the Covenant was Revealed to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12 1, 2, 3. It is a Formal Promiſe, that God would bleſs him, and all Nations in his Seed; and accordingly ever after it is called the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which <hi>Iſrael</hi> waited to ſee performed. And the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 18. affirms, that the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was given to <hi>Abraham</hi> by Promiſe and not by Law; and in <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, 16, 17. he maketh the Covenant and Promiſe equipollent terms. <hi>The Law,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which was</hi> 420 <hi>years after, cannot diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul the Covenant with</hi> Abraham, <hi>that the Promiſe ſhould be of none Effect.</hi> Neither was this Promiſe only of Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh, but of a Bleſſing through Chriſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. Yea, the giving of the Holy Spirit is a part of the Bleſſing Promiſed to <hi>Abraham; That the Bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come on the Gentiles through Jeſus; that we might receive the Promiſe of the Spirit through Faith.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. And indeed this is that therefore that renders it ſure, and certain to all the Seed therein concerned: For as it is evident, that this Goſpel Covenant, mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2, 3. was Preached unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> long before the Covenant of Circumciſion was made with him: So the Addition of the Covenant of Circumciſion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Law given by <hi>Moſes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of tranſgreſſions, till the Seed ſhould come, to whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made)</hi> could not diſannul, that it ſhould make this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and fore-eſtabliſhed Promiſe to be of none Effect. For it being moſt plainly a Goſpel Covenant, wholly free and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, and only to be received by Faith: Hence it follows, that it is of an Everlaſting, Unchangeable Nature; and conſequently ſure, without any poſſibility of Miſcarriage, unto all the Seed thereunto belonging (which the Covenant of Circumciſion, being Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, was not) as is moſt excellently reaſoned and argued by the Apoſtle to this purpoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. where he tells us, that <hi>the Promiſe that</hi> Abraham <hi>ſhould be the Heir of the World</hi> (which is the ſame in effect with his being the <hi>Father of all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> juſt before ſpoken of) <hi>was not to him, or to his ſeed,</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:50207:112"/> 
                  <hi>through the Law; but through the Righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi> Not through the Law; that is, not through the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, (as ſhall be afterward demonſtrated: For that was as much a Covenant of Works, as the Covenant at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was, and therefore a Legal Covenant) But through that mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2, 3. which was purely Evangelical; and therefore through the Righteouſneſs of Faith alone: Which gives the only Security to the Seed therein concerned, as is afterwards aſſerted, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15, 16. of the forementioned <hi>4th</hi> to the <hi>Romans; For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if they, which are of the Law be Heirs, Faith is made void, and the Promiſe made of none Effect; becauſe the Law worketh wrath: for where no Law is, there is no Tranſgreſſion. Therefore it is of Faith, that it might be by Grace, to the end the Promiſe might be ſure to all the Seed, not to that only which is of the Law</hi> (that is the <hi>Jews) but to that alſo that is of the Faith of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham (that is, the <hi>Gentiles) who is the Father of us all; as it is written, I have made thee Father of many Nations; according to that which was ſpoken; ſo ſhall thy Seed be.</hi>

               <p>§. 1. IT is indeed ſuggeſted by Dr. <hi>Burthogg;</hi> That the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Promiſe, <hi>That</hi> Abraham <hi>ſhould be the Heir of the World,</hi> (which as the Apoſtle tells, <hi>was not to him, or to his Seed through the Law; but through the Righteouſneſs of Faith)</hi> is to be underſtood in reference to <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 8. Where God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to <hi>give unto</hi> Abraham. <hi>and to his Seed after him, the Land of</hi> Canaan <hi>for an Everlaſting Poſſeſſion.</hi> From whence he infers, that the Covenant there mentioned, is a Covenant of Faith, and therefore a Covenant of Grace. But it doth not follow, becauſe <hi>Canaan</hi> was promiſed in the Covenant of Circumciſion, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, according to the Apoſtles reckoning, that Covenant ſhould be a Covenant of Faith: For as much as the Promiſe concerning <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Heirſhip of the World,</hi> which the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of, is of a vaſtly different Nature from the <hi>Promiſe of</hi> Canaan; or indeed any Terreſtrial Inheritance whatſoever.</p>
               <p>§. 2. It is true, as the Apoſtle tells us, That <hi>Godlineſs is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto all things;</hi> that is, in all reſpects; in reſpect of this World, as well as in reſpect of the other. And why ſo? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath the Promiſe: <hi>Having the Promiſe of the Life that</hi>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:50207:112"/> 
                  <hi>now is, as well as of that to come.</hi> In which reſpect it ought to be duly obſerved, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was promiſed <hi>Canaan</hi> long before the Covenant of Circumciſion was made with him: For ſo we are told, Gen. 12. 7. <hi>The Lord appeared unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>and ſaid, unto thy Seed will I give this Land.</hi> So Gen. 13. 15. <hi>All the Land which thou ſeeſt, to thee will I give it, and to thy Seed for ever.</hi> So likewiſe Gen. 15. 18. <hi>In that ſame day the Lord made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with</hi> Abraham; <hi>ſaying, unto thy Seed have I given this Land, from the River of</hi> Egypt, <hi>unto the Great River, the River</hi> Euphrates. From all which it plainly appears, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was promiſed <hi>Canaan</hi> long before the Covenant of Circumciſion was made with him: And it was indeed therefore a free Promiſe, or a part of that Covenant of Promiſe, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17, 18. which was afterward ratified and confirmed by Oath, ſo as that it ſhall never be diſannulled: For ſo we are expreſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, Pſal. 105. 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>He hath remembred his Covenant for ever, the Word which he commanded to a thouſand Generations; which Covenant he made with</hi> Abraham, <hi>and his Oath unto</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and confirmed the ſame unto</hi> Jacob <hi>for a Law, and to</hi> Iſrael <hi>for an Everlaſting Covenant; ſaying, unto thee will I give the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>the lot of your Inheritance.</hi> And though 'tis true, <hi>Canaan</hi> was only promiſed in the Letter, and was inherited only by the Carnal Seed and Deſcendants of <hi>Abraham;</hi> yet in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, it means the <hi>whole World,</hi> of which <hi>Canaan</hi> was a part, in which he took Poſſeſſion; or as it were, had Livery and Seiſin gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him in the name of the whole.</p>
               <p>§. 3. The like is to be ſaid concerning the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> even the Gentiles alſo, on whom that ſelf-ſame Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> (as being the fruit of the Free Promiſe) doth alſo deſcend. For in this reſpect it is that the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>all is ours:</hi> But how? <hi>For we are Chriſt's; and Christ is God's.</hi> And therefore as God hath promiſed, that <hi>the Meek ſhall inherit the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 37. 11. Mat. 5. 5. So he hath alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that <hi>the Kingdom and Dominion, and the greatneſs of the Kingdom and Dominion, under the whole Heaven ſhall be given to the People of the Saints of the Moſt High, whoſe Kingdom is an Everlaſting Kingdom,</hi> So likewiſe, Rev. 5. 10. <hi>Thou hast made us unto our God, Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall Reign upon the Earth.</hi> All which are glorious Promiſes, and ſhall certainly receive their full accompliſhment in the appointed Seaſon; as being indeed no other than Goſpel Promiſes; and of the ſame Nature with the free Promiſe of that kind, even the Promiſe of <hi>Canaan,</hi> made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  <hi>Abraham,</hi> long before the Covenant of Circumciſion was made with him. So that it is no wonder that the Apoſtle tells as he doth, that <hi>Godlineſs hath the Promiſe of the Life that now is, as well as of that that is to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. 'Tis true, <hi>Canaan</hi> was promiſed in the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion alſo as was alſo the Promiſe of a Coeleſtial Inheritance too: When God told <hi>Abraham, I will be a God to thee, and to thy Seed after thee; I will give unto thee, and to thy Seed after thee, the Land wherein thou art a ſtranger; All the Land of</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, <hi>for an Everlaſting Poſſeſſion; and I will be their God,</hi> Gen. 17. 7, 8. But all theſe Promiſes, though good enough in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet being <hi>Conditional,</hi> they were therefore <hi>failable,</hi> and ſtill liable to <hi>forfeiture,</hi> as they were contained in <hi>that Covenant.</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle would have us ſtrictly to obſerve, that the forementioned Promiſe, concerning <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Heirſhip</hi> (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſignifies) <hi>was not to him, or to his Seed through the Law, but through the Righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi> For though it ſhould be granted that it hath reference to a Terreſtrial Inheritance in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and conſequently to his Intereſt in the whole World, in the ſenſe but now mentioned: Yet foraſmuch as this Promiſe wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> made unto him, long before his Circumciſion; and was therefore a part of the free Promiſe: The Apoſtle doth ſufficiently ſuggeſt, that that was th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Promiſe he had moſt reaſon to truſt unto, or to relie upon, as being a far ſurer Promiſe of the two (and that both to himſelf and his Seed alſo) than was the Promiſe of the ſame kind, as it was contained in the Covenant of Circumciſion; which the Scripture doth ſo plainly repreſent unto us as a <hi>Conditional Covenant. The Promiſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was not to him nor to his Seed, through the Law.</hi> And why not through the Law? <hi>Becauſe</hi> (as he alſo tells us in the very next following words) <hi>If they which are of the Law be Heirs, Faith is made void, and the Promiſe made of none; effect: Becauſe the Law worketh wrath; for where no Law is, there is no Tranſgreſſion. Therefore, it is of Faith, that it might be by Grace; to the end the Promiſe might be ſure to all the Seed.</hi> The like he tells the <hi>Galatians</hi> alſo, chap. 3. 18. <hi>If the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be of the Law, it is no more of Promiſe; But God gave it to</hi> Abraham <hi>by Promiſe.</hi> Which clearly argues the Freeneſs, or Abſoluteneſs thereof; which the Covenant of Circumciſion was not: It being evident, that it obliged all that were under it to Perfect and Univerſal Obedience, as the Condition of Obtaining thc Mercies therein contained, Gal. 5. 3. <hi>For I teſtifie to every man that is Circumciſed, that he is a Debtor to do the whole Law.</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:50207:113"/> And therefore though 'tis true, <hi>Canaan</hi> was promiſed in that Covenant as well as in the other; as was alſo the Promiſe of the Coeleſtial Inheritance too; when God promiſed <hi>to be a God to</hi> Abraham, <hi>and to his Seed;</hi> yet thoſe Promiſes there mentioned, being bounded as they were with Conditions impoſſible to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore of a Legal Stamp, and liable to forfeiture: That is not the Way, that is not the Channel, through which the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in Promiſe muſt be derived unto the Heirs of Promiſe: For if ever they be derived, it muſt be through the Free Promiſe, and through that alone. Yea, if ever they be derived, it muſt be through the Free Promiſe. or not at all. For (ſaith he) verſ. 21. <hi>If there had been a Law given, that could have given Life, verily Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law: But the Scripture hath concluded all under ſin, that the Promiſe by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. But as we have already ſaid, the Promiſe that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be <hi>the Heir of the World,</hi> is of a vaſtly different nature from <hi>the Promiſe of</hi> Canaan; neither indeed is it at all contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Covenant of Circumciſion, where the Promiſe of <hi>Canaan</hi> is inſerted: For it is evident, that the Promiſe that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be the Heir of the World, hath a ſingle reference to <hi>his Fatherhood unto all them that believe;</hi> that is, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> or <hi>the whole World of Believers.</hi> Thus <hi>Pareus</hi> in his Comment upon the Place, carries the ſenſe of the Words; and ſo the Apoſtle himſelf interprets it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11, 12. And it is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that there is no Promiſe at all of that kind in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Circumciſion, that <hi>Abraham ſhould be the Common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all them that Believe;</hi> That Covenant having a plain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Natural Poſterity only;</hi> for as much as all thoſe to whom the Promiſes of that Covenant were made, were bound to be Circumciſed, as the Sign or Token of it; which doth not concern the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at all.

               <p>§. 1. BUT whereas the Doctor lays a mighty ſtreſs upon thoſe words of the Apoſtle before mentioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>For the Promiſe that he ſhould be the Heir of the World was not to</hi> Abraham <hi>or to his Seed through the Law; but through the Righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi> Whereby he endeavours to prove that the Covenant of Circumciſion, mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9. is that very Covenant of Grace that the Believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> are now under, and from whence all their hopes and Comforts are derived: We muſt of neceſſity therefore endeavour to overrhrow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the ſeeming ſtrength of what he offers by way of oppoſition to what we have aſſerted, before any thorow Concluſion can be drawn.</p>
               <p>§. 2. The Sum then of his Argument is this; <q>It is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (ſaith he) that the Covenant of Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is called the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> is ſtill in being; and is the Covenant of Grace, into a Participation of which the true Believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> are taken; which is the true ground and Foundation of all their hopes and Comforts: For thus the Apoſtle carries it when he affirms that God gave the Inheritance to <hi>Abraham</hi> by Promiſe. And by what Promiſe, but that ratified Covenant of Promiſe. <hi>I will be a God to thee and to thy Seed.—</hi>In ſhort (ſaith he) this is the Climax. If Believers then Chriſts; If Chriſts then <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed; If <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed then Heirs according to the Promiſe: For the Promiſe is; <hi>I will be a God to thee and thy Seed; And I will give to thee and thy Seed.</hi> Nor doth it make any alteration in the caſe, that Faith is now the requiſite condition of Salvation; or that we muſt believe to be ſaved. This but Evidences the more clearly that the Goſpel is but a Renovation of the Covenant of <hi>Abraham:</hi> For as it is through Faith that we <hi>Gentiles</hi> do become Chriſts, and by being Chriſts that we become the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and conſequently Heirs of Salvation according to the Promiſe; ſo it was through Faith, the Righteouſneſs of Faith that <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the Faithful had the Promiſe himſelf. For ſo the Apoſtle, Rom. 4. 13. <hi>For the Promiſe that he ſhould be the Heir of the World, was not to</hi> Abraham, <hi>or to his Seed through the Law; but through the Righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi> And if the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50207:114" rendition="simple:additions"/> Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> be the ground and Foundation of all our hopes and expectations as we are Chriſtians, and it be the true Covenant of Grace, to be ſure it is ſtill in being, or we do but beat the Air, and are at a loſs; our hope is in vain, and our rejoycing vain, which God forbid.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I know you take it for a very ſtrong Argument, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8. cannot be the Evangelical or Goſpel Covenant, becauſe it is a Mixt one, and Compoſed of a Temporal (as well as an Eternal) bequeſt: But for that Reaſon, I the rather take it to be Evangelical: For this is Goſpel, that <hi>Godlineſs is profitable unto all things,</hi> that is in all Reſpects; In reſpect of this World, and in reſpect of the other; And why ſo? Why it hath the Promiſe. <hi>Having the Promiſe of the Life that now is, as well as of that to come.</hi> And what is this but a finger to point you to the Covenant of Promiſe, as the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Covenant, the Promiſe, the Bleſſing that did deſcend on the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And indeed the Inheritance promiſed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and which in, by, and under him is deſcended on the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is not onely a Coeleſtial, but a Terreſtrial one alſo: For by that Promiſe <hi>Abraham</hi> was not onely the <hi>Heir of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> but alſo <hi>Heir of the World.</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle ſtyles him. And the ſame Apoſtle tells <hi>all is ours;</hi> And <hi>Abraham</hi> being Conſtituted by the Promiſe, Heir of the World; he and his deſcendants according to the Fleſh were to take Poſſeſſion of it, and to have Livery of Seiſin given in <hi>Canaan;</hi> a Livery of Seiſin, which was given indeed, and taken but in part of the World, (as Livery of Seiſin uſually is) but in the Name of the whole.</q> From the whole of which the Doctor Infers; That that Covenant mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8. where this Promiſe of a Terreſtrial Inheritance bequeathed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, is inſerted (which he takes to be the ſame with his being the Heir of the World) muſt be a Covenant of Grace, or an Evangelical Covenant: For ſince the Promiſe that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be <hi>the Heir of the World, was not to him, or to his Seed through the Law; but through the Righteouſneſs of Faith;</hi> Therefore the Covenant mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8. where this Promiſe is Inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, muſt of neceſſity be a Covenant of Grace, and ſuch a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as on which all the Hopes and Comforts of Believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> are Built.</p>
               <p>§. 3. This is the ſubſtance of what the Doctor offers; by which it may be eaſily perceived that there is a neceſſity that this now mentioned Argument of his, be ſubſtantially reſolved, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50207:115"/> removed out of the way, before we can draw any thorow Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Premiſes; It being true enough; That if <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Heirſhip of the World, ſpoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. And the Promiſe of a Terreſtrial Inheritance in <hi>Canaan,</hi> mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 8. be one and the ſame thing, and not of a quite different nature; then indeed, there will be ſome kind of appearance, or ſome ſhadow at leaſt of Argument in what the Doctor offers, toward the proof of what he aſſerteth; That the Covenant mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8. is the Covenant of Grace. Though ſhould it be granted that the Doctors Notion is right; That <hi>Abrahams</hi> Heirſhip of the World, is to be underſtood of the Promiſe of a Terreſtrial Inheritance in <hi>Canaan;</hi> Yet it will not therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Inheritance the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, is derived unto <hi>Abraham</hi> or to his Seed, through the Righteouſneſs of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and conſequently that it is a Goſpel Covenant: Becauſe (as hath been already obſerved) though that be one of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes contained in that Covenant; yet ſince the ſame thing had been before aſſured unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed alſo, by vertue of the free Promiſe, mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the Apoſtle takes ſuch ſpecial notice of <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. 18. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Conditional Covenant of Circumciſion, might be broken as it was; and the Mercies therein contained, forfeited, as they were; which the other could not: From hence it plainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the free Promiſe, and that alone, is that Covenant of Grace, or Anchor of Hope, that both <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed were onely to truſt unto, and through which the Inheritance was to be derived.</p>

               <p>HOwever, ſince the Doctor lays the ſtreſs he doth upon the Argument before us; It is neceſſary that it be Examined, and brought to the Teſt, whether right or no? In order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto our main buſineſs will be to prove that <hi>Abrahams Heirſhip of the World,</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. And the Promiſe that was made unto him of a <hi>Terreſtrial Inheritance in Canaan,</hi> mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 8. is not one and the ſame Promiſe; but of a vaſtly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Nature and Tendency. The one being the Great Charter of all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> hope and bleſſedneſs, in reference both to this World, and that that is to come; The other being the Promiſe of a Terreſtrial Inheritance onely, and that which concerned <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:50207:115"/> alone, and his Natural Off-ſpring. And if this can be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially proved, it will eaſily be acknowledged that the Doctors forementioned Argument falls to the ground. In order therefore hereunto two things muſt be done, and that is; Firſt diligently to Examin the Scope of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. where the words themſelves do lie that are the bottom of his Argument. And Secondly to compare that with other Scriptures that give light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>§. 2. As to the Scope of the place mentioned; It ought to be duely obſerved, that in the <hi>11th</hi> and <hi>12th</hi> Verſes, it is told us of <hi>Abraham,</hi> That <hi>he received the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith, which he had yet being <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cized, that he might be the Father of all them that Believe, though they be not Circumciſed, that Righteouſneſs might be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them alſo. And the Father of Circumciſion, to them who are not of the Circumciſion onely, but alſo walk in the ſteps of that Faith of our Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>which he had yet being <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed.</hi> The plain Scope of which is to ſhew that <hi>Abraham</hi> was appointed by God as <hi>the Common Father of all ſorts of true Believers whatſoever, whether</hi> Jews <hi>or</hi> Gentiles; And that this Divine Priviledge was not conferred on him upon the Account of the Works he had before ſpoken of <hi>Verſe</hi> 2. 3. or becauſe of his Circumciſion which was a main part thereof, and which he had been juſt now inſiſting on; but through Faith; Even, that Faith which he had <hi>yet being <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed.</hi> Which ſelf ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he further proſecutes in the next following words. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he immediately <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13.) <hi>the Promiſe that he ſhould be the Heir of the World, was not to</hi> Abraham <hi>or to his Seed, through the Law, but through the Righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi> Now let it be Judged what was the Apoſtles meaning, as to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Heirſhip of the World; whether it were concerning the Promiſe made unto him of a <hi>Terreſtrial Inheritance in Canaan,</hi> mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 8. that in <hi>that</hi> reſpect he ſhould be the <hi>Heir of the World?</hi> Or rather whether it is not to be underſtood concerning <hi>his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fatherhood to all them that Believe;</hi> which he had juſt before been ſpeaking of? For there he had been plainly treating, not concerning any <hi>Terreſtrial Inheritance</hi> whatſoever; but concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Abrahams Spiritual Relation as a Father to all ſorts of true Believers.</hi> And in that ſenſe the words in the <hi>13th Verſe</hi> come in moſt aptly and Conerently with what he had before told u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; which was that <hi>Faith was reckoned to</hi> Abraham <hi>for Righteouſneſs, not in Circumciſion, but in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion,</hi> even long before he
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50207:116"/> was Circumciſed. That <hi>he received the Sign of Circumciſion a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which he had yet being <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed that he might be the Father of all them that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> as well <hi>Jews</hi> as <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> as <hi>Jews, Verſ.</hi> 10. 11, 12. In which reſpect well might the Apoſtle tell us as he doth, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13. that <hi>Abraham</hi> was promiſed that he ſhould be <hi>the Heir of the World;</hi> Since the whole World both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call, were now to become his Spiritual Seed by Believing.</p>
               <p>§. 3. And that this is the true Scope and Genuine Sence of the place, is plain alſo from the following words; when he comes to the proof of what he had Aſſerted, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 13. For (ſaith he <hi>Verſ.</hi> 14) <hi>If they which are of the Law be Heirs; Faith is made void, and the Promiſe made of none effect, becauſe the Law worketh Wrath: For where no Law is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is no Tranſgreſſion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of Faith that it might be by Grace, that the Promiſe might be ſure to all the Seed; not to that onely which is of the Law</hi> (that is the Jews) <hi>but to that alſo which is of the Faith of Abraham</hi> (that is the <hi>Gentiles) who is the Father of us all.</hi> What <hi>Promiſe</hi> is it the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh of? No doubt the ſame Promiſe he had ſpoken of juſt before, even <hi>the Promiſe that</hi> Abraham <hi>ſhould be the Heir of the World;</hi> or as he here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it; <hi>The Father of us all.</hi> But how doth that appear? Or where is that Promiſe? <hi>As it is Written</hi> (ſaith he Verſ. 17.) <hi>I have made thee a Father of many Nations, before him whom he Believed; even God who quickeneth the dead; who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the Father of many Nations, according to that which was ſpoken; ſo ſhall thy Seed be.</hi> Wherein it is evident what was the Apoſtles meaning when he tells us of the Promiſe that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be <hi>the Heir of the World;</hi> that is, not that he ſhould be <hi>the Heir of Canaan,</hi> or of any <hi>Terreſtrial Inheritance</hi> whatſoever (though that be true too, and is a part of the ſame Goſpel Covenant, as hath been before proved; and ſhall therefore be gloriouſly fulfiled in the appointed Seaſon; when not <hi>Canaan onely</hi> ſhall be the Poſſeſſion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of Gods People; but <hi>the greatneſs of the Kingdom and Dominion under the whole Heaven ſhall be given unto them)</hi> But that which the Apoſtle intends in theſe words, is, that <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Relation</hi> whereunto <hi>Abraham</hi> was deſigned and appointed by God, as <hi>the Father of many Nations; Or the Father of all them that Believe; according to that which was ſpoken ſo ſhall thy Seed be.</hi> Wherein he plainly refers to the Goſpel Covenant
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50207:116"/> which was firſt Recorded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2, 3. that God had made with <hi>Abraham</hi> before his removal out of his own Country; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore long before the Covenant of Circumciſion was made with him: For then God firſt promiſed that <hi>he would make of him a Great Nation; make his Name Great;</hi> and that <hi>in him ſhould all the Families of the Earth be bleſſed;</hi> which free Goſpel Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was again repeated; <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 5. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 4, 5. where it is promiſed, that there ſhould be of the Nations innumerable, that ſhould be <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed by Believing. To which the Apoſtle plainly refers in the forementioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>As it is written</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have made thee a Father of many Nations, before him whom he believed; according to that which was ſpoken, ſo ſhall thy Seed be.</hi> For in this reſpect we are told, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. That <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham believed in the Lord, and he counted it to him for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. And in reſpect of this Covenant it is, that the Apoſtle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, as before, that <hi>the Promiſe is ſure to all the Seed.</hi> For as herein was promiſed a Bleſſing unto all the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> even the whole Family of the Faithful throughout the World, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles;</hi> of whom, through Chriſt, he was to be Father (whereas there is no ſuch Promiſe contained in the Covenant of Circumciſion:) So the tenor of it being purely Evangelical (which the Covenant of Circumciſion was not:) This therefore, and not the other, is the Great Charter, and only Firm Deed of Gift, by which the Believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> always did, and do claim Heaven and Earth, and all the Promiſes they have Title to.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Beſides, that the Promiſe that <hi>Abraham ſhould be the Heir of the World,</hi> cannot be underſtood of an <hi>Earthly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> but the <hi>call of the</hi> Gentiles; and conſequently hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his Univerſal Fatherhood to all ſorts of true Believers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles;</hi> is yet further evident from what the ſame Apoſtle tells us, Rom. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Have they ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi> (ſaith he, ſpeaking of the <hi>Jews) that they ſhould fall? God forbid: But rather through their fall Salvation is come unto the</hi> Gentiles. <hi>Now if the Fall of them be the Riches of the World, and the Diminiſhing of them the Riches of the</hi> Gentiles; <hi>How much more their Fulneſs?</hi> And ſo likewiſe verſ. 15. <hi>If the Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of them, be the Reconciling of the World, what ſhall the Receiving of them be, but Life from the Dead?</hi> Where the ſame expreſſion is made uſe of in reference to the Call of the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50207:117"/> 
                  <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as had been before made uſe of <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 13. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Heirſhip: For as <hi>Abraham</hi> by Promiſe was to be <hi>the Heir of the World;</hi> ſo the Call of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is here ſaid to be <hi>the Riches of the World.</hi> The ſame expreſſion we have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in reference to Chriſt, 1 John 2. 2. <hi>And he is the Propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for our ſins; and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole World.</hi> Not for ours only; that is, not only for us <hi>Jews,</hi> but for the ſins of the whole World; that is, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> becauſe the Partition Wall between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> was now broken down. In the ſame ſenſe therefore, that Chriſt is here ſaid to be <hi>the Propitiation for the ſins of the whole World.</hi> In the ſame ſenſe is <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to be <hi>the Heir of the whole World;</hi> that is, he was conſtituted or appointed to be an Univerſal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto all them that Believe, not only <hi>Jews</hi> but <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo. And indeed, as the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> is hereby ſaid to come upon the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14. So had it not been for this Goſpel Promiſe, the poor <hi>Gentiles</hi> had ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without hope of Relief, or ground of Comfort; ſtrangers to the Covenants of Promiſe, and without God in the World; there being no ground of Relief, or hope of Comfort at all afforded unto them, from the Covenant of Circumciſion.</p>
               <p>§. 6. And in this reſpect therefore, whereas the Apoſtle tells us in the forementioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. That <hi>the Promiſe that</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>ſhould be the Heir of the World, was not to him, or to his Seed</hi> [through the Law] <hi>but through the Righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi> It is yet further obſerveble, that the <hi>Law</hi> he here ſpeaks of, and which he doth ſo manifeſtly contradiſtinguiſh or oppoſe unto <hi>the Righteouſneſs of Faith;</hi> cannot be underſtood concerning the Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> to that People in the Wilderneſs 400 years after <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time (though it was of the ſame nature:) But it muſt of neceſſity be underſtood concerning the Law, or Covenant of Circumciſion, which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, and his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Poſterity; which was extant in his own time. And that this is the Law which the Apoſtle here intends, will evidently appear, if we duly attend unto the ſcope of the Apoſtie in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of this fourth to the <hi>Romans:</hi> which was to ſhew, that <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf was not juſtified by Works; no not by his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, but by Faith, which he had long before he was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. For thus he begins, verſ. 1. 2. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, that</hi> Abraham <hi>our Father, as pertaining to the Fleſh, hath found? For if</hi> Abraham <hi>were juſtified by Works, he hath whereof to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but not before God. For what ſaith the Scripture?</hi> Abraham
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50207:117"/> 
                  <hi>believed God, and it was counted to him for Righteouſneſs.</hi> So then <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtified by Works before God, but by Faith alone. But how doth that appear? Why, thus it, appears, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. 10. Becauſe <hi>Faith was not reckoned to him for Righteouſneſs, when he was in Circumciſion, but in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion.</hi> And ſo verſ. 11, 12. <hi>He received</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which he had, yet being <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, that he might be the Father of all them that believe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) verſ. 13. <hi>the Promiſe that he ſhould be the Heir of the World</hi> (or as he had ſaid juſt before, that he ſhould be <hi>the Father of all them that believe) was not to</hi> Abraham, <hi>or to his Seed through the Law;</hi> (which muſt needs therefore be underſtood of the Law of Circumciſion) <hi>but through the Righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi> From whence, as it hath been already made evident, the Promiſe he here ſpeaks of, was not derived unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> or to his Seed, through the Covenant of Circumciſion; there being no ſuch Promiſe at all to be found in that Covenant: So it is as manifeſt that the Covenant of Circumciſion was not a Covenant of Faith; ſince it is here ſo plainly contradiſtinguiſhed, or oppoſed thereunto.</p>

               <p>ANd therefore, whereas the Apoſtle tells us of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the formentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. That <hi>he received the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which he had, yet being <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed.</hi> From thence to infer, that the Covenant of Circumciſion was a <hi>Covenant of Faith;</hi> would be point blank to contradict the whole ſcope and deſign of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the foregoing paſſages of that Chapter; which (as hath been alredy ſhewn) as it was in general to prove, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtified by <hi>Works,</hi> but by <hi>Faith only,</hi> verſ. 2. 3, 4, 5. So in particular to aſſure us; that <hi>Faith was not reckoned to him for Righteouſneſs, when he was in Circumciſion, but in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> verſ. 9, 10. And what more convincing Teſtimony or Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can we deſire, that the Covenant of Circumciſion was not a Covenant of Faith?

                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:50207:118"/> &amp;c. <hi>upon Condition, that he and his were Circumciſed;</hi> were any part of the <hi>Covenant of Faith:</hi> For otherwiſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle would never have told us as he doth; that <hi>Faith was not reckoned to him for Righteouſneſs, when he was in Circumciſion, but in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion.</hi> The Argument hence reſulting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is Irreſiſtable: That Covenant in which Faith was not recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteouſneſs, could never be a Covenant of Faith: But the Scripture is expreſs, that <hi>Faith was not reckoned to</hi> Abraham <hi>for Righteouſneſs, when he was in Circumciſion, but in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion;</hi> therefore the Covenant of Circumciſion could never be a Covenant of Faith. Beſides it is evident, that long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Circumciſion, God had promiſed <hi>Abraham to bleſs him; to make his Name Great; that he ſhould be a Bleſſing; that in him ſhould all the Families of the Earth be Bleſſed; that he ſhould be the Father of many Nations, according to that which was ſpoken, ſo ſhall thy Seed be.</hi> Gen. 12. 2, 3. Gen. 15. 5. And it is evident that <hi>theſe were the Promiſes;</hi> upon the account where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are told, that <hi>he believed in the Lord, and he counted it to him for Righteouſneſs,</hi> Gen. 15. 6. Circumciſion therefore was a Seal only unto <hi>Abraham;</hi> and that of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which he had in reſpect of the Promiſes made him, <hi>long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Circumciſion;</hi> and that for this very purpoſe, that <hi>he might be the Father of all them that believe;</hi> which was his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative alone: For none beſides him had ever before their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, ſuch a Faith which entituled them to ſuch ſingular Promiſes.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Upon the whole; though it muſt be acknowledged that the Objection ſeems at firſt very Plauſible; <hi>How can it be but that the Covenant of Circumciſion muſt needs be a Covenant of Faith, ſince</hi> Abraham <hi>is ſaid to have received the Sign of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith?</hi> Yet we ſee when it comes to be duly examined, there appears no ſuch matter: For the only Argument fairly reſulting from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. can be no other than this. That Covenant, or thoſe Promiſes, in reſpect of which <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid to have received the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, muſt needs be a Covenant of Faith: But the Scripture is expreſs, that Abraham <hi>received the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which he had, yet being <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed:</hi> (which muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be underſtood in reſpect of the forementioned Promiſes, that had been made him long before his Circumciſion, and upon the account of which we are expreſly told, that <hi>he believed in the</hi>

                  <hi>Lord, and he counted it to him for Righteouſneſs,</hi> Gen. 15. 6.) Therefore that Covenant, or thoſe Promiſes, muſt needs be a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Faith. But then, as hath been already obſerved, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not, that <hi>the Promiſes made unto him, and his Seed after him, in their Generations; upon Condition of his, and their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi> mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9, 10. were any part of the <hi>Covenant of Faith;</hi> ſince the Apoſtle is expreſs, that <hi>Faith was not reckoned to him for Righteouſneſs, when he was in Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. Circumciſion therefore (as we have ſaid) was a Seal on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Abraham;</hi> and that in reſpect of the Promiſes, made him, <hi>yet being <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed;</hi> whereby he was Confirmed in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of that Peculiar Prerogative that had been before conferred on him; and which the Apoſtle here expreſly mentioneth. <hi>He received</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Faith which he had, yet being <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed, that he might be the Father of all them that believe.</hi> In reſpect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is evident, that Circumciſion was that to the Father of the Faithful, in its <hi>Extraordinary Inſtitution,</hi> and in his <hi>Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Circumſtances,</hi> that it could not be to any of his Natural Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny in its <hi>Ordinary <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> It was indeed appointed as a <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Token</hi> of the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9. and that both unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> himſelf, and the reſt that were under it; and ſo the Spirit of God himſelf expreſly ſtiles it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. Whereby they were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto a Perfect and Univerſal Obedience to the whole revealed Will and Law of God, Gal. 5. 3. <hi>For I teſtifie to every man that is Circumciſed, that he is a Debtor to do the whole Law;</hi> and hereof 'tis true, it was a <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Token:</hi> It being no other than the <hi>Restipulation</hi> of the Covenant on their part, Gen. 17. 9. 10. <hi>Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant therefore, thou and thy Seed after thee in their Generations; this is my Covenant which ye ſhall keep.—Every man-child among you ſhall be Circumciſed.</hi> But it doth not therefore follow, that becauſe it was a <hi>Token</hi> of that Covenant on their part, <hi>in reſpect of their Duty;</hi> that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo intended as a Seal unto them of the ſame Covenant on God's part, <hi>in reſpect of God's Promiſe:</hi> It being a <hi>Seal</hi> only unto <hi>Abraham;</hi> and that in reſpect of thoſe Peculiar Promiſes made him in Uncircumciſion. Nor was every ones Circumciſion, ſo much as a <hi>Token</hi> to him of his <hi>Right to any of the Promiſes</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained; as is evident in <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and others, the Servants born and bred in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, and Strangers bought with Mony, who were all to be Circumciſed; to whom yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50207:119"/> none of the Promiſes in that Covenant were made; as is plain from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 20, 21, 23, 27. whereby it is clear, that the true Reaſon why any were Circumciſed, was the <hi>Command,</hi> not <hi>Intereſt in the Covenant.</hi> Much leſs was Circumciſion a Seal to all that received it of their intereſt in the Righteouſneſs of that Faith that <hi>Abraham</hi> had. And it is equally abſurd to ſay, that Circumciſion was a Seal unto all its Subjects of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, which they had while Uncircumciſed; (ſince many of them were never Poſſeſſors of that ſaying Grace, neither before or after) as to affirm that it was the Seal of a Paternal Relation to all Believers, unto every one that received it; this being <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Peculiar Prerogative, and Incommunicable to any elſe. And indeed Circumciſion was ſo far from being a <hi>Seal of the Goſpel Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> or of their Intereſt in the Righteouſneſs of Faith, to the reſt that were under it, that it was rather<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Gal. 5. 2. 3. Which yet it had not been, had it been to them a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, or of the Goſpel Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: For that brings with it true Chriſtian Liberty and Freedom, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1.</p>

The betterneſs therefore of this Evangelical Covenant (whereof Chriſt is the onely Mediator and Surety) muſt of neceſſity conſiſt in the terms of it; the Promiſes thereof being free and Abſolute; and onely to be Received by Faith; (which the forementioned Covenants were not) And therefore called <hi>the Word of Faith which we Preach,</hi> Rom. 10. 6, 7, 8. <hi>That if thou ſhalt Confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in thine Heart that God raiſed him from the Dead thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> He had told us before that <hi>Moſes deſcribeth the Righteouſneſs of the Law, that the Man which doth theſe things ſhall live by them: But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Righteouſneſs which is of Faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe, &amp;c.</hi> So likewiſe Gal. 3. 21, 22. <hi>If there had been a Law which could have given Life, verily Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law: But the Scripture hath Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all under Sin, that the Promiſe by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that Believe.</hi> So alſo Rom. 4. 14. <hi>If they which are of the Law be Heirs, Faith is made void, and the promiſe made of none effect.

And therefore the Apoſtle having ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Now to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his Seed were the Promiſes made; he ſaith not, And to Seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy Seed, which is Chriſt.</hi> To give a convincing Evidence that he meant it of Chriſt <hi>Perſonal,</hi> and not <hi>Myſtical</hi> (as ſome have Dreamed) he doth ſufficiently explain his meaning in this Reſpect, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 19. where he tells us, that <hi>the Law was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſion, till the Seed ſhould come to whom the Promiſe was made.</hi> Where it is obſervable that the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50207:121"/> Law (that is the Moſaical Adminiſtration) is ſaid to have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Seed was come, and was to have its Period then. Now if by the Seed, Chriſt be not to be underſtood Perſonally, but Myſtically, for the Viſible or Inviſible Church (take which you will) then the Law could not have been before the Seed: For God had his Church in the World from the Beginning of it; and more eſpecially in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, Four Hundred Years at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> of which Chriſt was the head, and they his Myſtical Body. And ſo by this Interpretation the Seed ſhould have been before the Law; contrary to the Apoſtle, who makes the Law to have been before the Seed, and to have its Period when the Seed to whom the Promiſe was made was come. <q>Some do Interpret this Text in <hi>Gallatians</hi> of Chriſt <hi>Myſtical,</hi> becauſe of the Order of the Words. The Promiſe is made firſt unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> then unto his Seed; Therefore (ſay they) it is ſuch <hi>a Seed as</hi> comes to have Right in the Promiſe Second to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and as his Children.

It is evident therefore that the Promiſes of the Goſpel Covenant do all of them run to Chriſt the Inheriting Seed; to him they are made; In him do they all Center; And by him alone are they to be Communicated to all his Members. So that thoſe words of the Apoſtle <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. are unfitly applyed to <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8.

And which afterward was Solemnly Renewed and Confirmed unto him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 17, 18.

That <hi>when God made Promiſe to</hi> Abraham, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could Swear by no greater he Sware by himſelf; Saying, Surely, in Bleſſing I will Bleſs thee, and Multiplying, I will Multiply thee; wherein</hi> (ſaith he) Verſ. 17. <hi>God willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the Heirs of Promiſe the Immutability of his Counſel, Confirmed it by an Oath, that by two Immutable things, wherein it is Impoſſible for God to lie, we might have ſtrong Conſolation, &amp;c.</hi> But what Promiſe is it that the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of, which was thus Confirmed both by word and Oath? Was it the Promiſe or the Promiſes of the Covenant of Circumciſion, mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8. <hi>I will be a God to thee and to thy Seed, &amp;c.</hi> By no means: For that as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved was a Legal Covenant, and is therefore now done away. And beſides we do not find any Oath at all affixed, or annexed thereunto for the Confirmation thereof; As neither had the Legal Covenant at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> for the Confirmation of that. But the Promiſe which the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of, hath a plain Reference unto the Evangelical Covenant before mentioned; which was firſt made with <hi>Abraham</hi> before his Removal out of his own Country, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 2, 3. which was afterward Repeated and Confirmed unto him by an Oath, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. where God tells him, Verſ. 16. 17, 18. <hi>By my ſelf have I Sworn (ſaith the Lord) that in Bleſſing I will Bleſs thee</hi> (the ſame words the Apoſtle uſeth) <hi>and in Multiplying I will Multiply thy Seed as the Stars of Heaven, and as the Sand which is upon the Sea Shore. And thy Seed ſhall Poſſeſs the Gate of his Enemies. And in thy Seed ſhall All the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed;</hi> which is a full and a plain Repetition of the Covenant which God firſt made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Gen.</hi> 12. 2, 3. Saying, <hi>I will make of thee a great Nation, and I will Bleſs thee, and make thy Name great, and thou ſhalt be a Bleſſing. And I will Bleſs them that Bleſs thee, and Curſe him that Curſeth thee; And in thee ſhall all the Families of the Earth be Bleſſed.</hi> In both which Scriptures we have a fair and full Recital of that truely Evangelical or Goſpel Covenant, which God made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> And upon which all the Hope and Comfort of Believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> is firmly built and founded. And it is plain that this is the onely Covenant, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, and as it were points with his Finger unto it, Reciting the very words and expreſſions of it (without taking any notice at all of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50207:122"/> the Covenant of Circumciſion, or of any Expreſſions therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained) as having been Confirmed before of God in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. And that as he here tells the <hi>Hebrews, both by word and Oath, that by two Immutable things in which it is impoſſible for God to lie, there might be ſtrong Conſolation afforded unto all the Heirs of Promiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2.

                  </gap> contained in this Goſpel Covenant, in reference to <hi>Abraham;</hi> The like we cannot but obſerve in reference to Chriſt himſelf the Promiſed Seed: Unto whom God doth not onely here Promiſe, That <hi>in him ſhould all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed:</hi> But alſo, That <hi>he ſhould Poſſeſs the Gate of his Enemies.</hi> Both which are moſt full and Comprehenſive Promiſes; And that as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Bleſſings of this World, as of that which is to come. Upon which account it is highly obſervable, That as all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, both of the one ſort as well as of the other, do all run unto Chriſt the Inheriting Seed; ſo from and by him alone they are to be Communicated to all his Members: Foraſmuch as he needs them not for himſelf. And therefore when God told <hi>Abraham,</hi> That <hi>in his Seed ſhould all the Nations of the Earth be Bleſſed,</hi> as he doth therein promiſe to be our God, through Chriſt the Mediator; And by him to bleſs us with all <hi>Spiritual Bleſſings,</hi> by giving unto us <hi>an Inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, which is reſerved in Heaven for us:</hi> So in like manner; When God tells <hi>Abraham,</hi> That <hi>his Seed ſhould Poſſeſs the Gate of his Enemies,</hi> God doth herein Promiſe to give unto us, through Chriſt, the Bleſſings, even of <hi>this World</hi> alſo: For ſo it is Explained in Reference to Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 1, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Why do the Heathen rage?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet have I ſet my King upon my Holy Hill of</hi> Sion. <hi>I will declare the Decree: The Lord hath ſaid unto me, Thou art my Son, this Day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I ſhall give thee the Heathen for thine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the Earth for thy Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> To which ſame purpoſe we are alſo told, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. That <hi>upon the Sounding of the Seventh Angel, there were Great Voices in Heaven, ſaying, The Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall Reign for ever and ever.</hi> From both which we may clearly diſcern the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50207:123"/> meaning of that Promiſe, That Chriſt ſhould <hi>Poſſeſs the Gate of his Enemies;</hi> Even that the Actual Soveraignty of the whole World ſhould at length be Committed unto him, as <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> For which very purpoſe he now ſitteth at the Right Hand of God, <hi>from henceforth expecting till his Enemies be made his Footſtool,</hi> Heb. 10. 12, 13. which Promiſe; as it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made unto Chriſt himſelf, ſo it is of mighty Conſequence unto his People alſo; Since upon the foot of this Promiſe depends all their happineſs in this World; As upon the other, their happineſs in that that is to come. For if Chriſt be Exalted in this World, ſo ſhall his People alſo. And if <hi>the Kingdoms of this World</hi> are to become <hi>The Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt,</hi> ſo alſo ſhall <hi>the Kingdom and Dominion, and the greatneſs of the Kingdom and Dominion under the whole Heaven, be given to the People of the Saints of the moſt High,</hi> Dan. 7. 27.

The ſame Seed therefore that is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> verſ. 7, 8. is the Subject of the <hi>Obligation,</hi> verſ. 9, 10.

For it cannot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that the Goſpel Bleſſing ſhould be derived to any of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Natural</hi> Offspring <hi>one-way,</hi> and to Believing <hi>Gentiles another:</hi> But they muſt all, both the <hi>one</hi> as well as the <hi>other,</hi> be behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt for the Bleſſing, if ever they have it: For if all the Nations of the Earth are Bleſſed in Chriſt; then the <hi>Jews</hi> as well as the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> muſt all of them, if at all, be Bleſſed that way alſo, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 29.</p>
               <p>§. 5. In the Covenant of Circumciſion indeed God promiſeth <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be a God, not only to him, <hi>but to his Seed after him,</hi> in their Generations; meaning his <hi>Natural</hi> Offspring; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Bleſſing is <hi>immediately</hi> pronounced upon them all: But that was only upon <hi>Condition of their Obedience:</hi> As was alſo that at <hi>Sinai; which Covenant they brake, they Continued not in it, and God regarded them not,</hi> Heb. 8. 8, 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And both being of the ſame Stamp made with the ſame People, and making up one and the ſame <hi>Old Covenant;</hi> it is therefore now Aboliſhed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>Coll.</hi> 2. 14. So that that could not be the <hi>Promiſe</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of. How are we then to underſtand thoſe words of <hi>Peter</hi> before mentioned, <hi>The Promiſe is unto you, and to your Children?</hi> Why, plainly thus, Though the <hi>Conditional</hi> Covenant of Circumciſion is now done away: So that you have no further pretence, or Plea of <hi>that</hi> kind left you: And though the Prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> Covenant do all of them run directly to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Promiſed Seed; yet ſtill he might juſtly enough aſſure them that <hi>the Promiſe was to them, and to their Children alſo:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had therein promiſed that <hi>in</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Seed,</hi> that is, in Chriſt, <hi>All the Families of the Earth ſhould be Bleſſed.</hi> And upon this Bottom there was ſufficient ground of Comfort, not only for the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>their Children;</hi> But for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo, that were <hi>afar off; even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call:</hi> this being a moſt full and comprehenſive Promiſe; every way free and abſolute; and therefore Miniſtring Suitable Relief, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Jews themſelves,</hi> that had been <hi>the Betrayers and Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Lord of Glory;</hi> yea and unto <hi>their Children</hi> alſo, on whom, as well as on themſelves, <hi>they had wiſhed his Blood to be:</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:50207:130"/> And therefore though the Original Grant, or Promiſe was not made unto them, or their Children; or to any others <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately;</hi> yet at Second-hand Rate, at leaſt, it did ſufficiently apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain both unto them and their Children alſo: For, ſaith he, Acts 3. 26. <hi>God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to Bleſs you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.</hi> Which he doth immediately ſubjoyn upon his Rehearſal of the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned General Promiſe, that <hi>in</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Seed ſhould all the Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of the Earth be Bleſſed; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you firſt, God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to Bleſs you,</hi> &amp;c. Whereby as <hi>Peter</hi> doth ſufficiently intimate, that the Promiſe was both unto them and their Children alſo; ſo that God would no longer deal with them <hi>immediately,</hi> as he had done in the Covenant of <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> and in the <hi>Legal</hi> Covenant made with their Fathers at <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai;</hi> or by any <hi>meerly Humane Mediator</hi> whatſoever, as then: But they muſt expect all their Bleſſings <hi>now</hi> at the hand of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> For (ſaith he) <hi>God hath ſent him to Bleſs you,</hi> &amp;c And ſo likewiſe, Act. 5. 31. <hi>Him hath God exalted with his own Right hand to be Prince and a Saviour, for to give Repentance unto</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the forgiveneſs of Sins.</hi> Hands off therefore from the <hi>Old</hi> Covenant; whether that in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, or the <hi>Covenant of Circumciſion</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time: For <hi>God is a Conſuming Fire,</hi> and there is no dealing with him at that Rate any longer; but through the <hi>Mediation</hi> of Chriſt alone; <hi>who hath obtained a more Excellent Miniſtry, by how much alſo he is the Mediator of a Better Covenant which is eſtabliſhed upon better Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>

               <p>FOR a Concluſion therefore of the preſent Point; It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that as the forementioned Covenants, both that mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9. as well as thoſe mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. were all <hi>Conditional,</hi> and therefore <hi>Legal</hi> Covenants; requiring ſtrict and perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as the <hi>Condition</hi> propounded, in order to the Enjoyment of the Mercies Contained in them: Which are all of them therefore <hi>done away in Chriſt.</hi> So on the other hand, we ſee that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that God made with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12. 2, 3. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 2, 3, 4. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 16, 17, 18. was wholly <hi>Free,</hi> and <hi>Abſolute,</hi> and therefore purely <hi>Evangelical,</hi> and that which never ſhall be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annulled,</hi> being Confirmed both <hi>by Word and Oath;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>ſure</hi> to all the Seed therein concerned.

                  </gap>he Covenant mentioned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. As was alſo the Covenant which God made with <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 9. 9, 10, 11.

Wherein, as well as in
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50207:131"/> the <hi>Goſpel</hi> Covenant before mentioned, which the Believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> are now under; the terms are not <hi>Conditional</hi> or <hi>failable;</hi> I will, if ye will: But <hi>Abſolute</hi> and <hi>Soveraign; I will,</hi> and <hi>ye ſhall.</hi> So that that which God had before required, as the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of the Covenant of Works, and was not before <hi>Promiſed;</hi> is now become a main <hi>Branch</hi> of the Covenant of <hi>Promiſe</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>§. 2. And therefore, when the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21. That <hi>if there had been a Law given, that could have given Life, verily Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law;</hi> from hence it appears; that the Goſpel Covenant doth more for us, than the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal did: For it giveth <hi>Life,</hi> and then Enables to the <hi>performance</hi> of that which it requireth of us; whereas from what the Apoſtle there tells us, it appears that the Legal Covenant did not give Life, and that it failed becauſe it was <hi>Conditional.</hi> The Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>ſhews</hi> us our Duty, but gives no <hi>ſtrength</hi> to perform it. The Goſpel Covenant doth both, by <hi>Writing the Law in the Heart.</hi> Hence it is truely and properly a Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> as not depending at all upon <hi>Works: For if it be of Works, then it is no more Grace; otherwiſe Work is no more Work,</hi> Rom. 11. 6. <hi>And if by Grace, then it is no more of Works: Otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace.</hi> And therefore Chriſt is ſaid to have obtained a more Excellent Miniſtry than that of <hi>Moſes, by how much alſo he is the Mediator of a better Covenant, which is Eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes,</hi> Heb. 8. 6. 'Tis true the Promiſes for the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of them (as hath been before obſerved) are the ſame as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People.</hi> But now the terms are altered: For whereas before it depended upon the <hi>Works of our Obedience;</hi> Now <hi>Faith alone</hi> is required in order to the <hi>receiving;</hi> and conſequently in order to our <hi>participation</hi> of them. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> directs the Jaylor. <hi>Believe on the Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Acts 16. 31. So Rom. 4. 5. <hi>To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that Juſtifieth the ungodly, his Faith is Counted for Righteouſneſs.</hi> And in like manner the Apoſtle tells us, Gal. 3. 22. <hi>That the Scripture hath Concluded all under Sin, that the Promiſe by Faith of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>might be given to them that Believe.</hi> Not that Believing is the <hi>Condition</hi> of the Promiſe, (as 'tis generally Aſſerted) but a <hi>Deſignation</hi> rather of the Perſons to whom the Promiſe is given; that is, to <hi>Believers;</hi> or a <hi>Declaration</hi> of the Way, in which the Promiſe is given, that is in a way of <hi>Believing.</hi> For indeed Faith
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50207:131"/> is not the <hi>Condition,</hi> but the <hi>Fruit</hi> of the Promiſe: For if it be the <hi>Condition;</hi> either it muſt be <hi>wrought by us</hi> of our ſelves; Or it muſt be <hi>given us of God.</hi> If it be to be wrought by our ſelves; Then is the Promiſe of Grace worſe and harder than the Covenant of <hi>Works</hi> which God made with our Firſt Parent: For though it was required of <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>do and live;</hi> yet he had then <hi>a Power of Doing;</hi> But ſo have not we of <hi>Believing:</hi> Yea no more was required of him than was put into his <hi>Nature:</hi> For the Covenant of Works was Written in his <hi>Nature;</hi> but ſo is not Faith in <hi>ours.</hi> If it be given us of God (as the Scripture doth plainly affirm it is, Eph. 2. 8. <hi>For by Grace are ye ſaved through Faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the Gift of God)</hi> then it is given by vertue of ſome <hi>Promiſe:</hi> For God gives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by vertue of ſome <hi>Promiſe;</hi> which Promiſe can be no other than the Free <hi>Promiſe,</hi> the Promiſe of <hi>Grace:</hi> From whence it plainly follows, that the Covenant of Grace is wholly free and <hi>Abſolute;</hi> Since Faith it ſelf is the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and therefore cannot be the <hi>Condition</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>§. 3. So that the Material Difference between the Covenant of Grace and that of Works, Conſiſteth in the Different <hi>Terms</hi> of either: The one being <hi>Conditional,</hi> the other free and <hi>Abſolute.</hi> Not that we are therefore diſcharged from <hi>Duty</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> For as the Apoſtle tells us by way of Anſwer to the ſame Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, Rom. 3. 31. <hi>Do we then make void the Law through Faith? God forbid, yea we Eſtabliſh the Law.</hi> Becauſe that Obedience which was before, the Obedience of Servants, and Slaves, is now become Filial, or Son like; Not for Life, as under the Legal Covenant: but from a Principle of Life already received, which Powerfully Conſtraineth, and Effectually Enableth unto the Love, and Service of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. 15. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 8. It is certain therefore, that Working is required under the Covenant of Grace, as much as under the Covenant of Works it ſelf: But not for the ſame <hi>purpoſe,</hi> nor from the ſame <hi>Principle.</hi> Not for the ſame <hi>Purpoſe;</hi> foraſmuch as no Works of any kind whatſoever, as done or Performable by us, are at all deſigned as the matter of our <hi>Juſtification</hi> before Gods Preſence, under the Goſpel Covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. though they were ſo propounded under the Legal, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5. Nor from the ſame <hi>Principle:</hi> Foraſmuch as Good Works are not Previous to Faith, but the Conſequent of it: That being the onely Principle from whence all true Goſpel Obedience flows, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>§. 1. HAving therefore, we hope, Subſtantially proved that the Covenant of Circumciſion, which God made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and his Natural Poſterity, mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8. 9, 10. was no other than a Covenant of Works; As alſo that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant mentioned <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. wherein the <hi>Jews</hi> and their little ones were Concerned, was of the ſame ſtamp; as well as that made at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. All which were but ſeveral Repetitons of the Covenant of Works made with our Firſt Parent; And therefore called <hi>the Old, or the Firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, Heb.</hi> 8. 7, 13. And foraſmuch as 'tis as plain and evident, that they are all of them done away in Chriſt, as hath been already proved: From hence therefore, it unavoidably follows, that all the Arguments for the Support of Infants Church Memberſhip and Baptiſm under the Goſpel, which are founded upon the like Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges granted unto the Natural Poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> under the former Adminiſtration; do of themſelves fall to the ground: Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Covenants themſelves, which thoſe Priviledges were then Bottomed upon, are now Repealed. Neither is there any Room left for any other or further Argument from either of thoſe forementioned Covenants, to Infer the Baptiſm of Infants: The Obligation upon Believers Concerning the Goſpel Sign, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly left unto the time of its Inſtitution; which determines both the Duties and the Subjects thereof, to the Excluſion of Infants; as hath been before abundantly proved.</p>
               <p>§. 2. But whereas it is Objected; That ſince according to the Scope of the foregoing Diſcourſe, every Conditional Covenant is a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works: From whence 'tis Inferred, that ſuch was the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all the three forementioned Covenants; both that at <hi>Sinai;</hi> that in the Land of <hi>Moab;</hi> and that made with <hi>Abraham</hi> alſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9. And Conſequently, that they are all of them now Repealed: The Abſurdity of this Concluſion (ſay they) is manifeſt; Foraſmuch as the Goſpel Covenant it ſelf that we are now under, is a Conditional Covenant: Since Faith and Repentance are therein plainly required as the Conditions of Life.</p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:50207:132"/>
               <p> §. 3. To this we Reply; Firſt, Let the true ſtate of the Caſe be duely Conſidered, and it cannot juſtly be denyed, but that every Conditional Covenant is a Covenant of Works; that is, if Faith, Repentance, and Good Works muſt be Required as the Conditions thereof: Since it is not the greatneſs, or goodneſs of the Promiſes, that are the Subſtance of the Covenant, or wherewith even the Goſpel Covenant it ſelf is Repleniſhed, that Excuſe it from being a Covenant of Works, if Works muſt be the Condition of Obtaining the Mercies therein promiſed. For let Men diſtinguiſh as they pleaſe, betwixt Perfect Works, and thoſe of Sincere Obedience onely, though Imperfect, which we are told the Goſpel now Requires as the Conditions of Life: This is Certain: that to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe New Conditions of Obedience, though never ſo mild; is a New Covenant of Works with ſome Mercy; but not a Covenant of Grace, properly ſo called, or a Goſpel Covenant. For this was that wherein the very Eſſence of the Covenant of Works Conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>It required Obedience with a Promiſe of Life Annexed; where Man ſhould have but his Wages for his Work, and Periſh if he failed of Obedience.</hi> Or thus; The Covenant of Works Conſiſted in this: <hi>That upon our Perſonal Obedience, according unto the Law and the Rule of it, we ſhould be Accepted with God and Rewarded by him.</hi> And indeed what elſe maketh, or wherein elſe Conſiſteth the true Form or Nature of a Covenant of Works, but that Works be the Condition of it? This was the whole entire Nature of the Firſt Covenant, which alone renders it Eſſentially or Specifically different from the Promiſe of Grace or the Goſpel Covenant. And what ever Covenant proceedeth on theſe terms, or hath the Nature of them in it, however it may be varied, or lenified with milder Conditions of Obedience than the firſt was; ſo long as this Rule is retained; <hi>Do this and live:</hi> It is the ſame Covenant ſtill, and not another, for the Subſtance or Eſſence of it. If (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6.) <hi>it be by Grace, then is it no more of Works; Otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace: But if it be of Works, then is it no more Grace; Otherwiſe Work is no more Work.</hi> Works are Works ſtill, and Obedience is Obedience ſtill, whether Perfect or Imperfect; And therefore if Imperfect Obedience will be Accepted of God, as the Condition of Life, the Covenant is to be denominated, and hath it's Form from the Condition. Perfection, or Imperfection of Obedience, are but Circumſtances. If then a Man be Juſtified by Goſpel Obedience, which is Sincere, though Imperfect, as the Compleat
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:50207:133"/> Condition of the Covenant; then this Covenant is a Covenant of Works as well as the other; Onely that of Perfect, this of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Works. Which being allowed, though it ſeems more eaſie; yet it doth indeed render our Condition, and the Goſpel Covenant we are now under (as hath been before obſerved) worſe and harder than that made with <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf: Since we have now no Strength to Obey, nor Power to fulfil this Condition of Imperfect Obedience, though in the leaſt or loweſt degree; No not ſo much as to a thought: Whereas our Firſt Parent was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a Capacity ſufficient for the diſcharge of the moſt Perfect Obedience.</p>
               <p>§. 4. And if you ſay, that God requireth nothing of us, but what he giveth Strength and Grace to perform, having to this purpoſe Promiſed to <hi>put his Laws in our Hearts, and his fear in our Inward parts:</hi> This doth but ſo much the more clearly evince the Freeneſs, or Abſoluteneſs of the Goſpel Covenant; ſince this Goſpel Promiſe can depend on no Condition on our part: For whatever is Antecedent thereunto, being onely a Work or Act of Corrupted Nature, can be no Condition whereon the Diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Spiritual Grace is ſupperadded. From whence it plainly follows, that the Covenant of Grace is wholly free and Abſolute: Foraſmuch as there is nothing that can be ſuppoſed as the Condition thereof, whether it be Faith, Repentance, or New Obedience, which is not therein Abſolutely Promiſed.</p>
               <p>§. 5. But whatever may be Alledged for or againſt, in theſe Reſpects, as to the Goſpel Covenant we are now under: This is evident, and cannot with any ſhadow of pretence be juſtly Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted; That that Covenant that requires Perfect and Univerſal Obedience to the whole Revealed Will and Law of God; and Pronounceth a Curſe upon the leaſt. Tranſgreſſion or Diſ-obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, muſt needs be a Covenant of Works, or elſe there was never any ſuch thing Extant in the World. And of this Nature we have already proved the forementioned Covenants to be, <hi>viz.</hi> that made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> that in the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> and that made with <hi>Abraham</hi> alſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9. Our preſent Queſtion therefore (whereon the Main Hinge of the Paedo-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Controverſy doth depend, and which we would therefore drive to an Iſſue) is onely this: Whether that Covenant that will not admit of a Partial, though Sincere Obedience; but ſtrictly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that which is Perfect, and Univerſal, as the Condition of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50207:133"/> Salvation; be not a plain Covenant of Works? If ſo, then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſtly denyed, but that the ſeveral forementioned Covenants are ſuch; And Conſequently they are all of them now Repealed, as hath been already proved. From whence it plainly follows that no Juſt Argument can be drawn from either of theſe Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants for the Eſtabliſhment or Regulation of Goſpel Worſhip: For ſince the Law it ſelf is changed, and diſ-annulled, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do plainly affirm it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12, 18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 7, 13. there follows of neceſſity a change of the whole Fabrick and Conſtitution of the Ordinances thereunto once belonging: For ſo the Apoſtle himſelf Reaſons, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>The Prieſthood</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>being changed, there is made of neceſſity a change alſo of the Law.</hi> And if the Law is changed, there follows with an equal neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a change alſo of the Ordinances, thereon depending, and that news ones take place ſuitable to the Nature of the Goſpel Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that Succeeds it. And Conſequently the Plea for Infants Baptiſm, as founded on either of thoſe forementioned Covenants, muſt of neceſſity fail: Foraſmuch as what ever Right Infants had to the Ordinance of Circumciſion, which you ſay was Analogous therewith, the Right they then had was onely by vertue of thoſe forementioned Covenants; which being now Repealed, it una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably follows, that all the Arguments thence deduced for the Eſtabliſhment of Infants Church Member-ſhip and Baptiſm under the Goſpel, muſt of neceſſity alſo vaniſh.</p>

               <p>§. 1. AS to what Concerns the Covenant of Grace, or the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Covenant before Inſiſted on; We are told indeed by ſome that to affirm, that it is wholly free and Abſolute; and to make that the Covenant of Grace, properly ſo called, which God made with Chriſt; is to deſtroy the whole Tenor of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and to lay the Foundation of all Libertiniſm, and Looſeneſs of Converſation. In Reference whereunto, we ſhall take leave to Inſert a Paſſage or two of the late Worthy Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> in his Third Volumn upon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, page</hi> 15. <q>It cannot be denyed (ſaith he) but that ſome Men may, and it is juſtly to be feared, that ſome Men do abuſe the Doctrine of the Goſpel, to Countenance themſelves in a vain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Mercy and Pardon, whilſt they willingly live in a Courſe of Sin: But as this in their Management is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal means of their Ruine; So in the Righteous Judgment of God, it will be the greateſt Aggravation of their Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And whereas ſome have charged the <hi>Preachers of Goſpel Grace,</hi> as thoſe who thereby give Countenance unto this Preſumption; It is an <hi>Accuſation</hi> that hath more of the <hi>Hatred of Grace</hi> in it, than of the <hi>Love of Holineſs:</hi> For none do, or can preſs the Relinquiſhment of Sin, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of it, upon ſuch Aſſured Grounds, and with ſuch Cogent Arguments, as thoſe by whom the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel, is fully opened, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. And as to what concerns the freeneſs, or Abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Goſpel Covenant; The Doctor (in his-Expoſition of the <hi>12th Verſe</hi> of <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>For I will be Merciful to their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs; and their Sins and Iniquities will I Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber no more, page</hi> 290. of his forementioned Diſcourſe) Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves; <q>That free and Soveraign, and undeſerved Grace in the Pardon of Sin, is the Original Spring and Foundation of all New Covenant Mercies, and Bleſſings. Hereby (ſaith he) and hereby alone, is the Glory of God and the ſafety of the Church provided for. And thoſe who like not Gods Covenant
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50207:134"/> on thoſe Terms, will Eternally fall ſhort of the Grace of it. Hereby all Glorying, and all <hi>Boasting in our ſelves,</hi> is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; which was that which God aimed at in the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and Eſtabliſhment of this Covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 29, 30, 31. For this could not be, if the Fundamental Grace of it did depend on any <hi>Condition,</hi> or Qualification in our ſelves.—Some ſpeak of an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Conditional Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> made with all Mankind. If there be any ſuch thing, it is not that <hi>here</hi> Intended: For they are all <hi>actually Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> with whom <hi>this</hi> Covenant is made. And the Indefinite <hi>Declaration</hi> of the Nature and Terms of the Covenant, is not the <hi>making a Covenant</hi> with any. And what ſhould be the <hi>Condition</hi> of this Grace here promiſed of the Pardon of Sin? It is, ſay they, that Men Repent, and Believe, and turn to God, and yield Obedience unto the Goſpel. If ſo, then Men muſt do all theſe things, before they Receive the Remiſſion of Sins: Yes. Then muſt they do them whilſt they are <hi>under the Law and the Curſe of it:</hi> For ſo are all Men whoſe Sins are not Pardoned. This is to make Obedience unto the Law, and that to be performed by Men whilſt under the Curſe of it, to be the <hi>Condition</hi> of Goſpel Mercy; which is to overthrow both the Law and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But then on the other hand it will follow, they ſay; <hi>that Men are Pardoned before they do Believe.—</hi>But then it muſt be conſidered. (1.) That the <hi>Communication and Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith</hi> unto us, is an Effect of the ſame Grace whereby our Sins are Pardoned, and they are both beſtowed on us by vertue of the ſame Covenant. (2.) That though the <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Pardoning Mercy</hi> unto our Souls, is in order of Nature conſequent unto Believing; yet in time they go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (3.) That Faith is not required unto the <hi>Procuring</hi> of the Pardon of our Sins, but unto the <hi>Receiving</hi> of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. To the ſame purpoſe He alſo ſpeaks, <hi>page</hi> 223. 224. of the ſame Diſcourſe. <q>The Promiſes of the Covenant of Grace (ſaith he) are better than thoſe of any other Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as for many other Reſons, ſo eſpecially becauſe the Grace of them <hi>prevents any Condition,</hi> or Qualification on our part. I do not ſay, the Covenant of Grace is Abſolute with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Conditions; if by Conditions we intend the Duties of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:50207:135" rendition="simple:additions"/> Obedience, which God requireth of us in and by vertue of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t Covenant: But this I ſay, the <hi>Principal Promiſes</hi> thereof, are not in the firſt place <hi>Remunerative</hi> of our Obedience in the Covenant; but <hi>Efficaciouſly Aſſumptive</hi> of us into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and Eſtabliſhing or Confirming in the Covenant. The Covenant of Works had its Promiſes; but they were all <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerative,</hi> reſpecting an Antecedent Obedience in us; (ſo were all thoſe which were peculiar unto the Covenant of <hi>Sinai)</hi> they were indeed alſo of Grace, in that the Reward did infinitely exceed the Merit of our Obedience: But yet they all <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> it, and the Subject of them was formally <hi>Reward</hi> onely. In the Covenant of Grace it is not ſo: For ſundry of the Promiſes thereof, are the means of our being taken into Covenant, of our entering into Covenant with God. The Firſt Covenant Abſolute was Eſtabliſhed on Promiſes, in that when Men were actually taken into it, they were encouraged unto Obedience by the Promiſe of a future Reward: But theſe Promiſes, namely, of the Pardon of Sin, and Writing of the Law in our Hearts, which the Apoſtle expreſly Inſiſteth on, as the Peculiar Promiſes of this New Covenant, do take place and are Effectual <hi>Antecedently</hi> unto our Covenant Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. For although Faith be required in order of Nature, Antecedently unto our actual Receiving of the Pardon of Sin; yet is that Faith it ſelf wrought in us by the <hi>Grace of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;</hi> and ſo its Precedency to Pardon, reſpects onely the Order that God hath Appointed in the Communion of the Benefits of the Covenant, and intends not that the Pardon of Sin i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>§. 4. We ſhall Conclude what concerns this Subject, with another Paſſage of the Doctors to the ſame purpoſe with the former, in his Acurate and Judicious Diſcourſe, Entituled, <hi>The Doctrine of Justification, through the Imputation of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, Explained, Confirmed, and Vindicated, page</hi> 156. <q>It is commonly ſaid (ſaith he) that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>New Obedience</hi> are the <hi>Condition</hi> of the New Covenant. But yet becauſe of the Ambiguous Signification, and various uſe of that Term (Condition) we cannot certainly underſtand what is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the Aſſertion. If no more be Intended, but that theſe things, though promiſed in the Covenant, and wrought in us by the Grace of God, are yet <hi>Duties</hi> indiſpenſibly required of us, in order unto the Participation and Enjoyment of the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50207:135"/> 
                     <hi>full end</hi> of the Covenant in Glory, it is unqueſtionably true. But, if it be intended, that they are ſuch a Condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as to be by us performed <hi>Antecedently</hi> unto the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of any Grace, Mercy, or Priviledge of it, ſo as that they ſhould be the Conſideration, and Procuring Cauſes of them, that they ſhould be all of them, as ſome ſpeak, the <hi>Reward of our Faith and Obedience;</hi> it is moſt falſe, and not onely contrary to Expreſs Teſtimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but deſtructive of the Nature of the Covenant it ſelf.</q>

               <p>§. 1. LAſtly, Whereas we do affirm, That though according to the Law of Circumciſion, Infants were Admitted and Reckoned as Members of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church; yet that Old Conſtitution being now pulled down, and all the Appurtenances and Priviledges thereunto belonging, being now Repealed; a New Church State according to the Nature of the Goſpel Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, is now Erected, into which none are Admitted a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Members, but Profeſſing Believers onely. By way of Reply hereunto we are told, <q>That Infants Relation to the Covenant; and the Univerſal Church as Members, was not Repealed by Chriſt, becauſe it was not founded onely on the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which if it had (ſay you) it were as ſuch Repealed: But Infant Church-Memberſhip taking place as an Ordinance of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Circumciſion was Enjoyned, or the Ceremonial Law Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, why then ſhould it ceaſe with it? To the ſame purpoſe we are alſo further told, That it was no part of the Typical Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, but a Moral Inſtitution of God, even from the Beginning of the World: God ever having made a diſtinction between the Seed of the Faithful, and the Seed of the Wicked, as Viſibly belonging to the ſeveral Kingdoms of God and of Satan.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. To this we Reply; Firſt, That this Notion of <hi>Infants Church-Memberſhip, before the Law of Circumciſion,</hi> is but a bare Affirmation, without Proof: For if it be ſo, that Infant Church-Memberſhip did indeed take place as an Ordinance of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50207:136"/> God, before Circumciſion, where is that Ordinance? Why, are we not directed to ſome place of Scripture where we may find it? Hath God Revealed it to ſome, and to none elſe? Or in what Antient Father ſhall we find it? Did any one ever ſay ſo before now? Therefore with what Confidence ſoever we are now told, That it was no part of the Typical Adminiſtration, but a Moral Inſtitution of God, even from the Beginning of the World, unleſs we are directed where to find that Inſtitution, whatever others do, we dare not preſume <hi>to be Wiſe above what is Written: Mal.</hi> 2. 15. is indeed alledged. <hi>And wherefore one? That he might ſeek a Godly Seed.</hi> But that can be underſtood of no other than a <hi>Legitimate</hi> Seed, in oppoſition to a <hi>Spurious</hi> Off-ſpring. And thus the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> do in their Annotations, carry the Sence of the place. As likewiſe doth <hi>Calvin, Camer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and divers others.</p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas we are told, That God ever made a Diſtinction between the Seed of the Faithful, and the Seed of the Wicked; What Diſtinction is it that is Intended? Did God ſingle them out, and Separate them by any <hi>Viſible Sign,</hi> or Character, before the Law of Circumciſion? It is evident he did not; Or did God diſtinguiſh them by his <hi>Providential Care of them,</hi> or <hi>Proviſion for them</hi> more than others? The Scripture is ſilent as to this alſo. Or did God Love them with a <hi>ſaving Love,</hi> more than the Children of Unbelievers, as viſibly belonging to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Kingdoms of God and of Satan; ſo as that all the Children of Believers from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> belonged to the Kingdom of God; and all the Children of Unbelievers belonged unto the Kingdom of Satan? This is indeed ſuggeſted by you, but not proved. But then if this was always the ſtate of the Caſe between Believers and Unbelievers, as to their Reſpective Seeds, and that both before and ſince the Flood, and that it ſo continues: Then according to this Rule, woe unto all the Children of Unbelievers, moſt deplorable and deſperate i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> their State, without any ground of Comfort, or Hope of Relief; contrary to the Experience of all Ages, whilſt we are aſſured that Grace is now Extended to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were not the Children of Believers, whilſt the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Branches,</hi> the Children of Believing <hi>Abraham,</hi> are cut off. But then we would willingly know, when <hi>the Sons of God took the Daughters of Men, and all Fleſh had Corrupted it's way,</hi> To what Kingdom did the Children of Believers belong then? Did not the Seed of Believers grow prophane and wicked as well
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50207:136"/> as others? That is undeniable. And did not the Seed of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, ſome of them prove Pious and Godly? This alſo appears, even in <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, whoſe Father was an <hi>Idolater,</hi> as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſuppoſed; he himſelf being bred up in <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whereas it is ſuggeſted, that there was always from the beginning, a Lineal Succeſſive Conveyance of Grace from the Parent to the Child. If ſo, it is ſtrange that <hi>all Fleſh</hi> ſhould ſo ſoon have <hi>corrupted its way,</hi> that God ſaw Cauſe to <hi>bring the Flood upon the World of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly.</hi> And ſurely if there had been any ſuch <hi>Covenant Holineſs,</hi> as is imagined before the Flood; there would have been ſome Godly Society, ſome greater Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Believers to have been preſerved, beſide <hi>Noah</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: Who were not all Godly neither; there was a <hi>Cham,</hi> even among them; which would not have been, if there had been ſuch a <hi>Lineal Conveyance</hi> of Grace and <hi>Covenant Holineſs,</hi> from the Father to the Son, as is affirmed.</p>
               <p>§. 5. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Though Infant Church-memberſhip did indeed take place, as an Ordinance of God before the <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> was inſtituted: It doth not therefore follow, that it was a <hi>Moral Inſtitution,</hi> and therefore not to be Repealed: For ſo did Sacrifices alſo, and the building of Altars for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, as is evident in what is related concerning <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Noah;</hi> and yet there is none but take it for granted, that they are now aboliſhed. Nay even Circumciſion it ſelf was in uſe in the Church of God 400 years before the Proclaiming of the Law to that People in the Wilderneſs; and yet there is none that reckons it therefore to be a Moral Inſtitution, or that queſtions the Repeal thereof, together with the reſt of thoſe Ceremonies which were impoſed on them till the time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
               <p>§. And whereas we are told, that if <hi>Infant Church-memberſhip be Repealed; it muſt be either in Juſtice or in Mercy.</hi> It may be neither in Judiciary Juſtice, nor in Favourable Mercy; but from a pure Act of God's Soveraignty, who, as he is higheſt Lord of all, may do with his own what he liſteth; having an Unlimitted and Boundleſs Right to Beſtow or Revoke what he pleaſeth, according to the Counſel of his own Will. For though <hi>the Gifts and Callings of God are without Repentance,</hi> in reſpect of Inward and Spiritual Bleſſings; yet not ſo in reſpect

               <p>§. 7. So that it clearly appears, that the Novel Opinion which hath been lately ſtarted concerning the Morality of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Church-memberſhip, hath no Scripture Foundation for the ſupport thereof; it being evident that as it came in with the Law of Circumciſion; ſo it went out and was Repealed with it. <hi>For the Prieſthood being changed, there is made of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity a change alſo of the Law,</hi> Heb. 7. 12. Which muſt needs include Circumciſion, with all the Appurtenances and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges thereunto belonging; as hath been before abundantly proved.</p>

               <p>§. 1. FOR a Concluſion therefore, unto the whole of what hath been offered on this Subject, in this and the foregoing parts of this Diſcourſe: It is now at laſt with all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility preſented unto God's People, to conſider whether it be not their high Concernment, Speedily and Effectually to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour a thorow Reformation of ſo great an Abuſe in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, as the Practice of Infant-Sprinkling hath been now proved to be: It being no other than the Change of a Divine Inſtitution; and that not only in reſpect of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, Infants being ſubſtituted in the Room of Profeſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting Believers: But alſo in reſpect of the due Form, or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its Adminiſtration; Sprinkling being uſed inſtead of Dipping: And ſo in both Reſpects <hi>making void the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt.</hi> It was the Commendation that <hi>Paul</hi> gave the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Corinth. 11. 1, 2. That <hi>they had kept the Ordinances, as they were delivered unto them.</hi> Certainly Jeſus Chriſt is very Punctual in things of this Nature; and he will one day call men to an account for their Deviations in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſuch importance. If men are careful to ſee that their Laws be ſtrictly obeyed, without which they reckon their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:50207:139"/> ſlighted; What may we think of the <hi>Laws of the Great King?</hi> And whether or no will he not reckon his Authority ſlighted in our preſent caſe, when he cometh to make Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning ſuch as have not demeaned themſelves according to the Divine Preſcript? We know with what ſeverity God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> for their preſuming to Change his Ordinance of Old, by Offering up <hi>Strange Fire, which he had not Commanded,</hi> Lev. 10. 1, 2. We know alſo what befel <hi>David,</hi> and the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had made a New Cart for the Carriage of the Ark, which was to have been born on the Prieſts ſhoulders only. They might have pleaded as well as you, that this was not expreſly forbidden: But yet nevertheleſs, <hi>For this Cauſe the Lord made a Breach upon them, for that they did not ſeek him after the due Order,</hi> 1 Chron. 15. 13. In reference whereunto let that Scripture alſo be duly conſidered, Iſa. 24. 5, 6. <hi>Becauſe they have tranſgreſſed the Laws, changed the Ordinance, broken the Everlasting Covenant; therefore hath the Curſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Earth, and they that dwell therein are deſolate; therefore the Inhabitants of the Earth are burned, and few men left.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. That Infants Baptiſm hath no Footing, nor Foundation at all in the Word of God, hath been already at large demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated. And that it is made uſe of to the Juſtling out, and making void the Commandment of Chriſt, in reference to the Baptiſm of Believers, hath been alſo evinced; and all the moſt Material Arguments, which are uſually urged for the ſupport thereof, have been with Scripture Evidence, Refuted. The Lord grant a hearing Ear, and an underſtanding Heart, and an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Mind, that the preſent Teſtimony riſe not up at laſt as a Witneſs againſt you: For the Lord, the God of gods, even the Lord, the God of gods, he knoweth, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> at length alſo ſhall know, if it be in Rebellion, or if it be in Tranſgreſſion againſt the Lord, that the preſent Witneſs is born; and if it hath not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been done with his Approbation, and at his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in order to the ſtirring up all that truly love and fear God's Name, to a ſincere endeavour after the Primitive Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that both in reſpect of Doctrine and Worſhip.</p>
